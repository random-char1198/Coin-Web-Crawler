Nano is down 0.31% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #121, with a live market cap of $820,303,390 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 133,248,297 NANO coins   and a max. supply of 133,248,298 NANO coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Nano , the top exchanges for trading in  Nano  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   Huobi Global ,    and   KuCoin .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Nano (NANO)?\nBilled as \"digital money for the modern world,\" Nano is a lightweight cryptocurrency that is designed to facilitate secure, practically instant payments, without fees, and addresses some of the major limitations of both legacy financial infrastructure, and many modern cryptocurrencies. Development of the project began in 2014 under the name RaiBlocks, and the coin (then termed XRB) launched the following year through a public faucet, which allowed users to claim small amounts of XRB after completing a captcha challenge. Users were allowed to complete as many captchas as they liked to increase their words — effectively trading their time and effort for XRB. RaiBlocks (XRB) was rebranded to Nano (NANO) in January 2018, with the new name chosen to better represent the speed and simplicity the project offers to users.  It is a peer-to-peer platform that uses a unique block-lattice data structure to allow users to easily transfer value to one another without relying on centralized intermediaries.  Unlike other platforms which typically use the combined proof-of-work of a massive mining network to achieve consensus, Nano instead uses a system known as Open Representative Voting (ORV) — which sees account holders vote for their chosen representative, who then work to confirm blocks of transactions securely.  ORV makes Nano extremely energy efficient, positioning it as a more environmentally friendly alternative to  proof-of-work  (POW)-based  cryptocurrencies .  Who Are the Founders of Nano? Nano was founded by Colin LeMahieu, a heavily experienced software developer and engineer with a wealth of experience working for prominent tech companies, including Dell, AMD and Qualcomm. Self-described as an inventor, LeMahieu has interests that range from space technology to physics and environmental sustainability, and is a well-known name in the digital currency space. He began working full time on Nano in 2017 and remains the CEO of the Nano Foundation — an organization created to drive the development and adoption of the Nano — to this day. Colin LeMahieu also pushed the vast majority of commits to Nano’s GitHub repo.  Beyond LeMahieu, the Nano Foundation has over a dozen other employees, including George Coxon, a graduate in Evolutionary Anthropology and experienced account executive, and the current COO of the foundation.  What Makes Nano Unique? As we previously touched on, Nano is designed to be fast. So fast, in fact, that most Nano transactions reach absolute finality within less than a second — compared to several minutes or even longer for many other major cryptocurrencies.  This speed makes Nano suitable for commercial payments, since merchants and retailers no longer need to worry about transaction delays when accepting payments.  Moreover, Nano transactions are completely free. Since representatives do not receive financial compensation for their efforts to secure the network, there is no need for a transaction fee. This makes Nano an ideal solution for processing micro-transactions, since users no longer need to worry about fronting a potentially expensive transaction fee when making small payments.  These features are enabled by its unique architecture. Unlike many cryptocurrencies which are built on top of a distributed ledger known as a  blockchain , Nano is instead built around a similar ledger technology called a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  This structure is highly reliable and allows Nano to process as many as 1,000 transactions per second (tps) — without requiring an energy-intensive mining network to maintain its integrity, positioning Nano as an eco-friendly digital payment option.

Stay on top of the market with the latest tips, tricks, and trends with the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Nano (NANO) Coins Are There in Circulation? Like the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, Nano has a fixed maximum number of tokens that will ever enter existence, this number is set at exactly 133,248,290 NANO. The original maximum supply was set much higher than this, but any remaining NANO tokens above the current 133 million limit were permanently burned. In total, around 39% of the original genesis supply was distributed.  Nano is unusual in the fact that its entire supply is already in circulation, this means it is fully diluted.  Because it is fully diluted, Nano is also highly decentralized, and well distributed, with the vast majority of Nano accounts holding less than 100 NANO. As of December 2020, around 20% of all Nano in circulation (~26 million) is held in one of the cold wallets associated with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange.  A total of 5% of the circulating supply was held back for the continued development of the project, this was allocated to a so-called “developer fund.”  How Is the Nano Network Secured? Nano is secured by a network of representatives, each of which is voted into position by NANO holders.  These representatives are responsible for casting their votes when the network needs to achieve  consensus , and their voting power is the sum total of the voting weight delegated to them by NANO holders. These vote on the validity of transactions on the Nano network, ensuring only valid transactions are confirmed.  This process protects the network against a type of attack known as a double spend—which occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate the network to effectively spend the same funds twice.  In addition, the Nano network features a wide variety of additional defenses against various possible attack vectors—a full overview of which can be found  here .  Where Can You Buy Nano (NANO)? Since Nano cannot be mined, the most popular way to get your hands on some is by purchasing it from one of the more than 50 exchange platforms that support it.  Binance ,  OKEx  and  Huobi Global  are currently among the most popular exchanges for Nano to crypto trading pairs, whereas it can also be bought with fiat on Kraken and Binance.US.

Polygon is up 10.28% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #18, with a live market cap of $14,161,523,908 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 6,804,312,959 MATIC coins   and a max. supply of 10,000,000,000 MATIC coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Polygon , the top exchanges for trading in  Polygon  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Polygon (MATIC)? Polygon (previously Matic Network) is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Polygon Matic . Using Polygon, one can create  optimistic rollup  chains,  ZK rollup  chains, stand alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer. Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc. with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness. The $MATIC token will continue to exist and will play an increasingly important role, securing the system and enabling governance. Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a  Layer 2  scaling solution backed by Binance and Coinbase. The project seeks to stimulate mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by resolving the problems of scalability on many blockchains. Polygon combines the Plasma Framework and the proof-of-stake blockchain architecture. The Plasma framework used by Polygon as proposed by the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, allows for the easy execution of scalable and autonomous smart contracts. Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem. Polygon boasts of up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, along with a respectable block confirmation time of less than two seconds. The framework also allows for the creation of globally available decentralized financial applications on a single foundational blockchain. The Plasma framework gives Polygon the potential of housing an unlimited number of decentralized applications on their infrastructure without experiencing the normal drawbacks common on proof-of-work blockchains. So far, Polygon has attracted more than 50 DApps to its PoS-secured Ethereum sidechain. MATIC, the native tokens of Polygon, is an  ERC-20  token running on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens are used for payment services on Polygon and as a settlement currency between users who operate within the Polygon ecosystem. The transaction fees on Polygon  sidechains  are also paid in MATIC tokens. Who Are the Founders of Polygon? Polygon (formerly Matic Network) was launched in October 2017. Polygon was co-founded by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun, two experienced blockchain developers and a business consultant. Before moving to its network in 2019, the Polygon team was a huge contributor in the Ethereum ecosystem. The team worked on implementing the Plasma MVP, the WalletConnect protocol and the widely-used Dagger event notification engine on Ethereum. The team included co-founder of Polygon, Jaynti Kanani. Jaynti, a full-stack developer and blockchain engineer currently serves as the CEO of Polygon. Jaynti played an integral role in implementing Web3, Plasma and the WalletConnect protocol on Ethereum. Prior to his blockchain involvement, Jaynti worked as a data scientist with Housing.com. Co-founder and chief operations officer of Polygon, Sandeep Nailwal is a blockchain programmer and entrepreneur. Before jointly starting Polygon (formerly Matic), Sandeep had served as the CEO of Scopeweaver, and the chief technical officer of Welspun Group. Anurag Arjun is the only non-programming co-founder of Polygon. As a product manager, he has had stints with IRIS Business, SNL Financial, Dexter Consultancy and Cognizant Technologies. What Makes Polygon Unique? Polygon is self-described as a Layer 2 scaling solution, which means that the project doesn’t seek to upgrade its current basic blockchain layer any time soon. The project focuses on reducing the complexity of scalability and instant blockchain transactions. Polygon uses a customized version of the Plasma framework which is built on  proof-of-stake  checkpoints that run through the Ethereum main-chain. This unique technology allows each sidechain on Polygon to achieve up to 65,536 transactions per block. Commercially, the sidechains of Polygon are structurally designed to support a variety of decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocols available in the Ethereum ecosystem. While Polygon currently supports only Ethereum basechain, the network intends to extend support for additional basechains, based on community suggestions and consensus. This would makePolygon an interoperable decentralized Layer 2 blockchain platform How Many Polygon (MATIC) Tokens Are There in Circulation? MATIC tokens are released on a monthly basis. MATIC currently has a circulating supply of 4,877,830,774 MATIC tokens and a max supply of 10,000,000,000 MATIC tokens. At its initial private sale in 2017, 3.8 percent of MATIC’s max supply was issued. In the April 2019 launchpad sale, another 19 percent of the total supply was sold. The MATIC price was $0.00263 per token, and $5 million was generated. The remaining MATIC tokens are distributed as follows: Team tokens:  16 percent of the total supply. Advisors tokens:  4 percent of the total supply. Network Operations tokens:  12 percent of the total supply. Foundation tokens : 21.86 percent of the total supply. Ecosystem tokens:  23.33 percent of the total supply. According to the release schedule, all the tokens will be released by December 2022. How Is the Polygon Secured? As a  Layer 2 solution  utilizing a network of proof-of-stake validators for asset security, staking is an integral part of the Polygon ecosystem. Validators on the network will stake their MATIC tokens as collateral to become part of the network’s PoS consensus mechanism and will receive MATIC tokens in return. Members of the network who do not wish to become validators can delegate their MATIC tokens to another validator, but will still take part in their staking process and earn staking rewards. In addition to the proof-of-stake checkpointing, Polygon uses block producers at the block producer layer to achieve a higher degree of decentralization. These block producers give finality to the main chains using checkpoints and fraud-proof mechanisms. Where Can You Buy Polygon (MATIC)? Being one of the projects that contributed a lot to the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, MATIC is popular among online exchanges focused on DeFi. The top exchanges where you can buy, sell, and trade MATIC currently are: Binance Coinbase Pro Huobi Global FTX KuCoin To check Polygon price live in the fiat currency of your choice, you can use CoinMarketCap’s converter feature directly on the  Polygon price page .

Synthetix is up 8.86% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #92, with a live market cap of $1,302,076,852 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 114,841,533 SNX coins   and a max. supply of 212,424,133 SNX coins.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Synthetix (SNX)? Synthetix is a decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocol that provides on-chain exposure to a wide variety of crypto and non-crypto assets. The protocol is based on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain and offers users access to highly liquid synthetic assets (synths). Synths track and provide returns on the underlying asset without requiring one to directly hold the asset. The platform aims to broaden the cryptocurrency space by introducing non-blockchain assets, providing access to a more robust financial market.  Who Are the Founders of Synthetix?  The network was launched in September 2017 by Kain Warwick under the name Havven (HAV). About a year later the company rebranded to Synthetix. Kain Warwick is the founder of Synthetix and a non-executive director at the blueshyft retail network. Prior to founding Synthetix, Warwick has worked on several other cryptocurrency projects. He also founded Pouncer, a live auction site exclusive to Australia. Peter McKean, the project’s CEO, has over two decades of experience in software development. He previously worked as a programmer at ICL Fujitsu. Jordan Momtazi, the COO of Synthetix, is a business strategist, market analyst and sales leader with several years of experience in blockchain, cryptocurrency, digital payments and e-commerce systems. Justin J. Moses, the CTO, was the former director of engineering at MongoDB and deputy practice head of engineering at Lab49. He also co-founded Pouncer. What Makes Synthetix Unique?  Synthetix is a decentralized exchange ( DEX ) and a platform for synthetic assets. The protocol is designed in a way that exposes users to the underlying assets via synths, without having to hold the underlying asset. The platform allows users to autonomously trade and exchange synths. It also has a staking pool where holders can stake their SNX tokens and are rewarded with a share of the transaction fees on the Synthetix Exchange. The platform tracks the underlying assets using smart contract price delivery protocols called oracles. Synthetix allows users to trade synths seamlessly, without liquidity/slippage issues. It also eliminates the need for  third-party  facilitators. SNX tokens are used as collateral for the synthetic assets that are minted. This means that whenever synths are issued, SNX tokens are locked up in a smart contract.  Since launch, the protocol has transitioned to the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet to help reduce the gas fees on the network and lower oracle latency. How Many Synthetix (SNX) Coins Are There in Circulation?  The maximum supply of SNX is 212,424,133 coins, of which 114,841,533 SNX is in circulation as of February 2021. At the seed round and token sale stages, Synthetix sold more than 60 million tokens and was able to raise $30 million. Of the total 100,000,000 coins issued during the ICO, 20% was allocated to the team and advisors, 3% to bounties and marketing incentives, 5% to partnership incentives and 12% to the foundation. How Is the Synthetix Network Secured?  The SNX token is compatible with Ethereum’s  ERC20  standard. The Synthetix network is secured through proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus. Synthetix holders  stake  their SNX and earn returns from the network fees. Another way for SNX stakers to earn rewards is via the protocol’s inflationary monetary policy, known as staking rewards.  Where Can You Buy Synthetix (SNX)?  SNX tokens can be purchased at top exchanges, such as: Binance OKEx Coinbase Pro Uniswap (V2) If you are interested in learning more about how to buy Bitcoin, read CoinMarketCap’s full guide  here .

Celsius is down 7.56% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #110, with a live market cap of $961,128,870 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 238,863,520 CEL coins   and a max. supply of 695,658,160 CEL coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Celsius , the top exchanges for trading in  Celsius  are currently  OKEx ,   FTX ,   ZT ,   Gate.io ,    and   HitBTC .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Celsius (CEL)? Celsius (CEL) is an all-in-one banking and financial services platform for cryptocurrency users.  Launched in June 2018, it offers rewards for depositing cryptocurrency, along with services such as loans and wallet-style payments. Users of the platform receive regular payouts and interest on their holdings. Celsius’ native token, CEL, performs a variety of internal functions, including boosting user payouts if used as the payment currency. Who Are the Founders of Celsius? Celsius originally came into being as the product of creators Alex Mashinsky and Daniel Leon in 2017. Mashinsky has a long-running history in the internet development sphere, having worked on the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) in the 1990s and other technologies since. Celsius is far from Mashinsky’s first corporate venture, with seven startups and 35 patents to his name, the project’s official website states. Co-founder and COO Daniel Leon meanwhile has experience focusing on growing early-stage startups. His previous roles include being CEO of Atlis Labs, a social recommendation and discovery app which used real-time user referrals. Celsius now has a large team of core employees, technical developers and advisors with experience in various spheres. What Makes Celsius Unique? Celsius aims to outperform banks at their own game by offering financial services on the kind of terms which traditional financial institutions no longer offer. These include much higher rates of returns on savings and deposits, much easier and fairer loan requirements and automated rewards computed for each user algorithmically. Penalties and bank-style fees are also waived. The platform also functions as a wallet via its CelPay feature, and hosts its own CEL token which users can leverage to increase payout value among other things. As a for-profit company, Celsius takes a cut of profit margins on interest payments, still returning 80% to users themselves. The company also lends to institutional entities such as hedge funds.  Payments are ensured because loans are asset-backed, and any borrower must supply more than 100% of what they borrow in the destination currency. Related Pages : Read more about Electroneum  here .

How Many Celsius (CEL) Coins Are There in Circulation? The native token of Celsius is CEL. It performs a number of user-related functions and is freely tradable outside the platform. CEL has a maximum supply of 695,658,161 tokens, of which 76% are in circulation and 24% are locked according to a schedule laid out in the project’s technical literature.  CEL had an initial coin offering ( ICO ) in May 2018. The presale and crowdsale took 50% of the token supply, with 27% going to the treasury, 19% to the team and 2% to partners and advertisers respectively.  CEL is an  ERC-20  standard token on Ethereum. How Is the Celsius Network Secured? Celsius uses a modified proof-of-stake algorithm for its token, while broader security procedures were outlined in a dedicated presentation in June 2020, still available on the company’s website. As with any client-orientated wallet, the risk of theft from attacks such as SIM-swapping is present if users themselves do not have adequate protections in place such as two-factor authentication. Where Can You Buy Celsius (CEL)? CEL is a publicly-tradable token on major exchanges, with pairs available for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. As of October 2020, automated market makers ( AMMs ) held the lion’s share of trading volume, with popular pairs being for  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Wrapped Ether  (WETH). New to cryptocurrency?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Theta (THETA)? Theta (THETA) is a  blockchain  powered network purpose-built for video streaming. Launched in March 2019, the Theta mainnet operates as a decentralized network in which users share bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer ( P2P ) basis.The project is advised by Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube and Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch. Theta features its own native cryptocurrency token, THETA, which performs various governance tasks within the network, and counts Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi, Sony Europe and Samsung as Enterprise validators, along with a Guardian network of thousands of community-run guardian nodes. Developers say that the project aims to shake up the video streaming industry in its current form — centralization, poor infrastructure and high costs mean that end users often end up with a poor experience. Content creators likewise earn less revenue due to the barriers between them and end users. Who Are The Founders of Theta? Theta was co-founded by Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long in 2018. Liu has a long history in the gaming and video industries, co-founding video advertising firm Tapjoy, mobile social gaming startup Gameview Studios, and THETA.tv, the live streaming platform whose  DApp  was the first to be built on the Theta protocol. Long is Theta’s second co-founder and CTO, following similar multi-year experience in design automation, gaming, virtual reality, and large scale distributed systems. He authored multiple peer-reviewed academic papers and holds various patents in video streaming, blockchain and virtual reality. Theta now has a modest team, and its official website lists strategic corporate investors as Samsung NEXT, Sony Innovation Fund, media investors BDMI Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, CAA Creative Artists Agency, and traditional Silicon Valley VCs including DCM, Sierra Ventures and the VR Fund. What Makes Theta Unique? Theta’s main business concept is to decentralize video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants. The network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA), Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy. Theta’s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen — video platforms — save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising and subscription revenues. Users have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens. The platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many  proof-of-stake  (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems. In addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) on its fully featured EVM-compatible Smart contract platform.

Find the answers to all your questions with  Alexandria , CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource. How Many Theta (THETA) Coins Are There in Circulation? Theta involves two tokens: THETA and TFUEL. THETA exists only for governance purposes, with 5 TFUEL tokens issued per 1 THETA held at the time of the mainnet launch in 2019. THETA itself launched in 2018, at which time it was distributed to buyers as an  ERC-20  token on  Ethereum . Afterwards, all ERC-20 THETA were converted to native THETA on the mainnet. The total supply of THETA is capped at 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. It is distributed in various proportions among all network participants, as well as the Theta team itself and a reserve pool. TFUEL is used to power transactions in a similar way to  gas  on Ethereum (ETH). Its total supply is 5 billion (5,000,000,000) tokens. How Is the Theta Network Secured? Theta uses a financial incentive scheme to ensure user participation in governance activities, and hence its network is secured by its own users. The network relies on proof-of-stake (PoS), and employs a multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerance ( BFT ) consensus mechanism to balance security with high transaction throughput. With the launch of Guardian nodes in June 2019, Theta ensured that no single entity controls the majority of THETA tokens being staked at any one time. Where Can You Buy Theta (THETA)? THETA, as the main token for the Theta platform, is freely tradable on major exchanges. Pairs include cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies and stablecoins.  As of October 2020, the highest volume pairs come from  Binance , with the most popular trading currency being stablecoin Tether (USDT). New to crypto?

Solana is up 12.04% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #6, with a live market cap of $68,765,561,965 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 300,938,476 SOL coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Solana , the top exchanges for trading in  Solana  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   FTX ,    and   Huobi Global .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Solana (SOL)? Solana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance ( DeFi ) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Solana . The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app ( DApp ) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus of the blockchain. Because of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Solana Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale. Who Are the Founders of Solana? Anatoly Yakovenko  is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks and became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox. In 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague  Greg Fitzgerald , and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020. What Makes Solana Unique? One of the essential innovations Solana brings to the table is the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus developed by Anatoly Yakovenko. This concept allows for greater scalability of the protocol, which in turn boosts usability. Solana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the incredibly short processing times the blockchain offers. Solana’s hybrid protocol allows for significantly decreased validation times for both transaction and smart contract execution. With lightning-fast processing times, Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest as well. The Solana protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Solana’s main promises to customers is that they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing. Combined with the longstanding professional expertise creators Anatoly Yakovenko and Greg Fitzgerald bring to the project, Solana is ranked number 7 in the CoinMarketCap  ranking  as of September 2021. This came on the back of an impressive bull run, where Solana price gained over 700% since mid-July 2021. The launch of the Degenerate Ape NFT collection sent SOL price to an  all-time high  (ATH) above $60, and it has been climbing since, largely due to higher developer activity on the Solana ecosystem, greater institutional interest, growing DeFi ecosystem, and the rise of the NFTs and gaming vertical on Solana. Solana price rose to an ATH of $216 on Sept. 9, 2021. Related Pages: Read more about  Steem . Check out  Marlin . Learn more about  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) . Curious about the crypto space?

Check out  CoinMarketCap exchange rate calculator . How Many Solana (SOL) Coins Are There in Circulation? The Solana Foundation has announced that a total of 489 million SOL tokens will be released in circulation. At the moment, about 260 million of these have already entered the market. The SOL token distribution is as follows: 16.23% went towards an initial seed sale, 12.92% of tokens were dedicated to a founding sale, 12.79% of SOL coins were distributed among team members and 10.46% of tokens were given to the Solana Foundation. The remaining tokens were already released for public and private sales or are still to be released to the market. Solana price during the initial seed sale, held on April 5, 2018, was $0.04. Given the recent ATH, that represents an impressive 5400X  return on investment  (ROI). How Is the Solana Network Secured? Solana relies on a unique combination of proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanisms. Proof-of-history is the main component of the Solana protocol, as it is responsible for the bulk of transaction processing. PoH records successful operations and the time that has passed between them, thus ensuring the trustless nature of the blockchain. The proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus is used as a monitoring tool for the PoH processes, and it validates each sequence of blocks produced by it. The combination of two consensus mechanisms makes Solana a unique phenomenon in the blockchain industry. Where Can You Buy Solana (SOL)? SOL tokens can be purchased on most exchanges. One choice to trade Solana is on  Binance , as it has the highest SOL/USDT trading volume, $753,103,225 as of September 2021. Next is  Coinbase , with a trading volume of $343,872,841. Other options to trade Solana include  FTX ,  Bilaxy  and  Huobi Globa l. Of course, it is important to note that investing in cryptocurrency comes with a risk, just like any other investment opportunity.

Kusama is up 5.32% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #50, with a live market cap of $3,771,140,193 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 8,470,098 KSM coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Kusama , the top exchanges for trading in  Kusama  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Kusama (KSM)? Self-described as \"Polkadot's wild cousin,\" Kusama is an experimental  blockchain  platform that is designed to provide a massively  interoperable  and scalable framework for developers. Kusama is built on Substrate — a blockchain building kit developed by Parity Technologies. Kusama has almost the same codebase as Polkadot — one of the most successful interoperable blockchains. By deploying on Kusama, fast-paced projects gain access to a highly scalable, interoperable sharded network, with features that are not yet available on Polkadot. To that end, Kusama describes itself as a “canary network.” The platform is designed to provide a testbed for developers looking to innovate and deploy their own blockchain and can be used as a preparatory network before launching on Polkadot — though many projects opt to stick with Kusama for their final product.  Kusama benefits from a low barrier to entry for deploying parachains, low bond requirements for validators, and is most commonly used by early-stage startups and for experimentation. Who Are the Founders of Kusama? Kusama was built by the same team that created Polkadot, a company known as Parity Technologies. Its founder is Dr. Gavin Wood, a world-renowned computer scientist and programmer, who also co-founded Ethereum. Parity Technologies has an extensive team comprised of some of the world's most successful blockchain engineers, and has over 100 employees in total spread throughout the world.  In addition, Kusama is funded by grants from the Web3 Foundation, which was launched to help \"nurture and steward technologies and applications in the fields of decentralised web software protocols.\" The Web3 foundation also supports Kusama with research and community development thanks to its growth team.  What Makes Kusama Unique? Kusama is unusual among blockchain platforms since it is predominantly built for developers that want to launch bold, ambitious projects, with a fast-evolving pace of development. It is built on a multichain, heterogeneously-sharded design that uses a nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus system — an alternative  consensus  mechanism to the energy intensive  proof-of-work  (POW) scheme employed by several other blockchains.  This system enables it to perform rapid on-chain upgrades without a fork, and support cross-chain message passing (XCMP) to enable communication with other parachains on the Kusama network. Like Polkadot, Kusama features on-chain governance capabilities. This on-chain governance is both decentralized and permission-less, allowing anybody with Kusama (KSM) tokens or parachain tokens to vote on their respective governance proposals, which might include putative upgrades, changes to the protocol, and feature requests. This on-chain governance procedure is roughly four times faster than that offered by Polkadot, with a combined voting and enactment period of just 15 days — leading to the rapid pace of development for projects built on Kusama.  The project serves projects that want to hit the ground running, launching updates and improvements without the need to implement a fork to do so — thereby ensuring maximum community cohesion.

Brush up on your crypto basics with  CoinMarketCap Alexandria . Visit the  CoinMarketCap blog  for the latest news, tips, tricks and market insights. How Many Kusama (KSM) Coins Are There in Circulation? As of November 2020, Kusama has a circulating supply of 8.47 million tokens, and a total supply of 10 million tokens. Unlike some other blockchains, this maximum supply is not fixed. Instead, it increases at an inflation rate of 10% per year.  The proportion of KSM that are  staked  changes how the newly minted KSM tokens (from inflation) are distributed. If exactly half of all KSM are staked, then Kusama validators receive 100% of newly minted tokens, whereas if it is above or below 50%, then some of the inflation rewards will go to the Kusama Treasury. Kusama initially launched as an airdrop to those that participated in Polkadot (DOT) token sale. These were distributed at a 1:1 rate, while those without DOT were able to obtain KSM by using a frictional faucet — this has since been decommissioned. Unlike Polkadot, Kusama has not undergone redenomination to increase its circulating supply. How Is the Kusama Network Secured? Kusama is built using a nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism.  This uses a network of nominators (KSM stakers) who elect nodes to participate in the transaction validation process. These nominators receive a fraction of the inflation reward if their nominator is selected on the next rotation. Validators that act dishonestly or don't meet performance requirements can have their stake slashed. Additionally, Kusama uses a simple queuing mechanism based on Merkle trees to resolve cross-chain transactions. Relay chain validators are responsible for moving transactions from the output queue of one parachain to the input queue of the target parachain — this is a secure, trustless process that uses the same validators on each chain to pass the messages.  Where Can You Buy Kusama (KSM)? Kusama (KSM) is currently available to trade on dozens of popular exchange platforms, including  Binance ,  OKEx  and  Huobi Global . The most liquid trade pairs for KSM are currently KSM/USDT, KSM/BTC and KSM/ETH.  To learn more about buying cryptocurrencies with fiat, see our  comprehensive guide .

Reserve Rights is up 0.49% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #144, with a live market cap of $564,946,521 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 13,159,998,943 RSR coins   and a max. supply of 100,000,000,000 RSR coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Reserve Rights , the top exchanges for trading in  Reserve Rights  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Reserve Rights (RSR)? Reserve Rights is a dual-token stablecoin platform that was launched in May 2019 following a successful initial exchange offering ( IEO ) on the Huobi Prime platform.  Reserve Rights’ dual token setup includes a stablecoin known as the Reserve  stablecoin  (RSV) — which is backed by a basket of assets managed by smart contracts. The second token is the Reserve Rights token (RSR), which is used to keep the RSV stable at its $1.00 price target through a system of arbitrage opportunities. Unlike RSV, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token is volatile, and its main purpose is to help maintain the stability of RSV. It can also be used to vote on governance proposals — helping holders shape the future of the Reserve Rights ecosystem.  In the later stages of the project, Reserve Rights plans to back the Reserve stablecoin by an increasingly diverse basket of assets, and eventually move it away from the U.S. dollar peg — instead creating an alternative reserve asset where RSV tokens instead represent fractional ownership of the collateral pool.  Who Are the Founders of Reserve Rights? Reserve Rights was co-founded by Nevin Freeman and Matt Elder. Freeman is Reserve's CEO and a seasoned entrepreneur. He describes his life goal as \"solving the coordination problems that are stopping humanity from achieving its potential.\"  Matt Elder, on the other hand, is an experienced engineer who previously worked for Google and Quixey, and now works to oversee the architecture of the Reserve protocol implementation as the project’s CTO. Since its launch in 2019, the Reserve team has grown considerably, and now includes more than two dozen individuals, which includes engineers, developers, and legal and compliance staff — all unified under the shared ambition to position Reserve as an open, massively scalable stablecoin that promotes economic prosperity. What Makes Reserve Rights Unique? Unlike other stablecoins that are typically backed by U.S. dollars (USD) held in reserve in a bank account controlled by the stablecoin issuer or a trusted custodian, Reserve stablecoins are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies managed by smart contracts.  This basket initially consists of Ethereum stablecoin assets, including USD Coin ( USDC ), True USD ( TUSD ) and Paxos ( PAX ), but there are plans to later transition to a more diverse basket, which might eventually include fiat currencies, securities, commodities and complex asset types, like synthetics and derivatives. Arguably Reserve's major defining feature is its Reserve Rights token, which is minted and sold when the RSV stablecoin loses its peg with the U.S. dollar. The funds generated by selling RSR tokens are used to replenish the RSV collateral pool, whereas when RSV is valued at above $1, the additional collateral will be used to purchase and burn RSR from the secondary market, driving down the supply.  Arbitrageurs can benefit from this mechanism when RSV is valued at above $1.00, by buying RSV at $1.00 from the Reserve smart contract using RSR, and then selling it at the current market price to net the difference as profit. This option is only available to RSR holders, and is currently one of the main drivers for holding RSR tokens.  Related Pages : Read about  DAI  — a similar stablecoin backed by a basket of assets.

Check out the  CoinMarketCap blog  to discover the latest insights and tools to help you stay on top of the market.  How Many Reserve Rights (RSR) Coins Are There in Circulation? Reserve Rights has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens. Out of this, less than 10% are currently in circulation as of October 2020.  The maximum token supply has already been pre-mined, but a large proportion is locked for various reasons, including 55.75% of the supply locked in a smart contract known as the \"slow wallet.” Funds from this wallet are released following a one-month delay with a public on-chain message from the Reserve team explaining the purpose of the withdrawal.  Although RSR has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens while on Ethereum, the Reserve team has  stated  that this maximum supply might change once Reserve moves to its mainnet — an event currently slated to occur in 2020.  The Reserve Rights token initially launched with a circulating supply of 6.85 billion tokens, of which 3% were distributed to Huobi Prime IEO participants, 2.85% released as project tokens and 1% to private investors. All team, advisor, partner, and seed investor tokens will remain locked until after the mainnet is launched. How Is the Reserve Rights Network Secured? Reserve Rights is currently an ERC-20 token based on the  Ethereum  blockchain. As a result, it is secured against  attacks  by a robust  proof-of-work  (POW) consensus mechanism backed by a network of thousands of Ethereum miners.  Reserve Rights is scheduled to migrate to its mainnet in 2020. As of October 2020, Reserve has not yet announced which  consensus  mechanism the new  blockchain  will use to secure the network.  Where Can You Buy Reserve Rights (RSR)? Reserve Rights (RSR) is a popular token that currently maintains excellent liquidity.  It is available to purchase and trade on several of the most well-established cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including Binance,  Huobi Global  and  OKEx , and can be traded against various popular cryptocurrencies, including  Bitcoin (BTC) ,  Tether  (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as the U.S. dollar (USD) on multiple platforms.  To get started, consider  buying Bitcoin  with your credit or debit card. You can then exchange this for Reserve Rights tokens on various exchanges.

If you would like to know where to buy  DMme , the top exchanges for trading in  DMme  are currently  Tidex ,    and   Crex24 .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is DMme (DMME)? DMme is a messaging application that uses the  Ethereum blockchain .  The main goal for DMme is to allow users to communicate securely, protecting both their identity and data, though “military grade end-to-end encryption.\"  The project was launched in January 2020 and is available in Google Play. Its iOS version was expected in April 2020, but hadn’t materialized by the end of the year.  There is little information available about when it might be available, while DMme’s official website does not seem to work. Who Are the Founders of DMme?­ The main name behind DMme is Twitter user CryptoMocho. They are responsible for giving updates on the project — and their messages are regularly retweeted by DMme’s official account.  The rest of the team known to the public also uses aliases. Gremlins and Scar69  are in charge of marketing, Bio logik is an advisor, Daywalker_ is a developer, while the source code was produced by a private development company. CryptoMocho has 129,000 followers on Twitter, but the DMme.app official account has just over 1,000 followers. The official account last posted in August 2020, giving no further updates about the project other than a video showing a “developer update.” In mid-July, a “sneak peak” of what the app would look like was released, containing four screenshots. What Makes DMme Unique? DMme is described as a messaging app that uses military encryption technology to protect user information.  While files and messages are stored on WhatsApp or Telegram servers, DMme is said to store all data in the user’s phone. To join the app, no phone number has to be shared and only an email address is needed. DMme encourages users to create a new email address when registering. Since there has been no  whitepaper  published, and the code is not open source, there is very little information about the technicalities of the project. It is said to use AES-256 encryption, which is the Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key size. DMme is an  ERC-20   token  using Ethereum’s blockchain. There are a couple of ERC-20 tokens that provide privacy features such as  Status  and  Orchid .  However, unlike DMme, these projects are open source and available for audit. Nevertheless, the idea is that the DMme token will be used to pay for subscriptions that allow the team to update the app and develop new features. The project is self-funded and, according to the DMme team, this ensures executives are invested in its success. Related Pages: Learn more about cryptocurrencies . Stay up-to-date with the latest crypto headlines . Subscribe to the CoinMarketCap newsletter . How Many DMme (DMME) Coins Are There in Circulation? There are just over six million coins in circulation, while the team is holding on to 10 million. According to the DMME Token Tracker, there were 270 DMME holders by the end of 2020, while a total of 60 million coins will be issued. How Is the DMme Network Secured? The DMme team is said to be planning to build an ecosystem around the app, which will include a  peer-to-peer  service where DMME would be used as a payment method. It is also said that DMme holders will be paid a monthly dividend for holding DMME  tokens . The official DMme.app Twitter account has a pinned tweet dated August 4, 2020, stating that anyone holding 100,000 DMME in their wallet would earn a share of 333,000 DMME on the 10th of each month as long as they hold DMME for a minimum of 20 days. Where Can You Buy DMme (DMME)? DMME is available at SatoExchange, Uniswap, Tidex and CREX24.  Read more here about how to buy Bitcoin.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Enjin Coin (ENJ)? Enjin Coin is a project of Enjin, a company that provides an ecosystem of interconnected,  blockchain -based gaming products. Enjin's flagship offering is the Enjin Network, a social gaming platform through which users can create websites and clans, chat, and host virtual item stores. Enjin allows game developers to tokenize in-game items on the  Ethereum  blockchain. It uses Enjin Coin, an  ERC-20  token, to back the digital assets issued using its platform, meaning that items can be bought, sold and traded with real-world value. Enjin Coin was first  announced  in July 2017, and it  launched  on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2018. Enjin Coin (ENJ) is a digital store of value used to back the value of blockchain assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nEvery asset minted with the Enjin Platform contains ENJ, a minting resource which is locked inside NFTs and removed from circulation. Minting blockchain assets with ENJ provides a variety of benefits to creators and users: Infuses them with a reserve value Ensures their transparency and scarcity Gives them instance liquidity Provides utility in games and apps Anti-inflationary Enjin's \"melting\" functionality allows users to destroy their blockchain assets at any time to retrieve the ENJ value from within. The Enjin blockchain ecosystem aims to offer software products that make it easy for everyone to develop, trade, monetize, and market with blockchain. Founded in 2009, Enjin has roots in the gaming industry, with the company’s first product, a gaming community platform called the Enjin Network, growing to 20 million users over the course of a decade. In 2017 following an ICO, Enjin established itself as a leading blockchain ecosystem developer, building a suite of software products that enable anyone to easily mint, manage, trade, distribute, and integrate blockchain assets. Enjin’s co-founder Witek Radomski wrote the code for one of the first ever non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and is also the co-author of the ERC-1155 Ethereum token standard. Built on top of an on-chain infrastructure, the Enjin ecosystem enables game developers and businesses of all sizes to use tokenized digital assets as part of their acquisition, retention, engagement, and monetization strategies. The Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), a cryptocurrency used to back the value of blockchain assets. Who Are the Founders of Enjin Coin? Enjin was founded as a gaming community platform in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski, with Blagov becoming CEO and assuming responsibility for the creative direction of the company and Radomski serving as chief technical officer, responsible for the technical development of its products. Blagov has  described  himself as having experience in creative direction, marketing, and software project management and design. The idea of introducing blockchain to Enjin was first proposed by Radomski after he became interested in  Bitcoin  (BTC) in 2012, eventually  convincing  the company to accept it as a payment option. After learning about Ethereum and  smart contracts , he decided he wanted to create his own blockchain-integrated software. Radomski is also the author of the ERC-1155 token standard, a new standard for Ethereum-issued tokens that was  introduced  in June 2018,  finalized  in June 2019, and is used for minting both fungible and nonfungible tokens. What Makes Enjin Coin Unique? According to co-founder Radomski, Enjin Coin is unique in that every token minted with Enjin Platform, the company's blockchain asset development platform that  launched  in February 2020, is directly backed by ENJ, giving in-game items real-world liquidity. Similarly, Blagov has  stated  that the company is focused on adoption, saying he imagines a future in which millions of gamers use digital items backed by Enjin Coin without even knowing it exists. Enjin Coin uses a series of smart contracts to which game developers send ENJ to mint new, unique fungible or nonfungible ERC-1155 tokens. These tokens can be traded on the Enjin Marketplace, which  launched  in September 2019, or exchanged for their backing ENJ at any time. As more custom tokens are minted, more ENJ is removed from the ecosystem, thus making it scarcer. According to its  whitepaper , Enjin Coin  uses  a series of both on-chain and off-chain processes. When a transaction is completed within the Enjin ecosystem, a Trusted Platform contacts the users' smart wallets, and the website or game is updated immediately with a placeholder or nontradable version of the digital item until the transaction has been validated by the Ethereum blockchain.

How Many Enjin Coin (ENJ) Coins Are There in Circulation? Enjin Coin has a fixed maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. However, as the ecosystem grows and more ENJ is locked into in-game digital assets, the number of coins actually circulating will decrease. Enjin Coin was first made available for purchase during a presale event in September 2017 in which 400 million ENJ was  sold  for a total of 38,800  Ether  (ETH), worth $12 million at the time, with another 100 million ENJ given away as bonuses. In total, the presale sold and gave away 50% of the total supply. An  initial coin offering  was held in October 2017, with 300 million ENJ — 30% of the total supply — available for sale. The ICO  raised  75,041 ETH,  worth  $18.9 million at the time. Tokens that were not sold during the ICO were locked for six months to be later used for community initiatives and marketing. 10% of the total token supply was  reserved  for the company for community initiatives, beta testing, marketing and strategic partnerships, while another 10% was reserved for team members and advisors. Team member tokens were locked for the first six months and vested over a period of 24 months, while advisor tokens were locked for two months and fully released afterward. How Is the Enjin Coin Network Secured? Enjin Coin is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that any on-chain ENJ transactions are validated and secured by the Ethereum network using a  proof-of-work   consensus  algorithm. Miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted. The underlying smart contracts that power Enjin Coin have undergone several audits, including by Ethereum developer Matthew Di Ferrante in  September 2017 , smart-contract auditor and developer ZK Labs in  early 2018 , and Castillo Network in  July 2019 . In October 2020, Enjin  launched  a bug bounty program via information security company HackerOne. Where Can You Buy Enjin Coin (ENJ)? Enjin Coin can be purchased on  cryptocurrency  exchanges such as  Binance ,  Bithumb ,  Uniswap (V2)  and  Balancer , among others. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  and  Ether , and  stablecoins  such as  Tether  (USDT) and  USD Coin  (USDC). It can be bought and sold on both spot and derivatives markets. Are you interested in buying ENJ or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin ?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Uniswap (UNI)? Uniswap  is a popular decentralized trading protocol, known for its role in facilitating automated trading of decentralized finance ( DeFi ) tokens. An example of an automated market maker ( AMM ), Uniswap launched in November 2018, but has gained considerable popularity this year thanks to the DeFi phenomenon and associated surge in token trading. Uniswap aims to keep token trading automated and completely open to anyone who holds tokens, while improving the efficiency of trading versus that on traditional exchanges. Uniswap creates more efficiency by solving liquidity issues with automated solutions, avoiding the problems which plagued the first decentralized exchanges. In September 2020, Uniswap went a step further by creating and awarding its own  governance token , UNI, to past users of the protocol. This added both profitability potential and the ability for users to shape its future — an attractive aspect of decentralized entities. Who Are the Founders of Uniswap? Uniswap came about as a plan to introduce AMMs on  Ethereum  to a wider audience. The platform’s creator is Ethereum developer Hayden Adams. Adams worked in various projects while finalizing Uniswap, and his work was informed directly by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin even ended up giving the protocol its name — it was originally known as Unipeg. Adams has also said that the original inspiration for the  Uniswap platform  came from one of Buterin’s own blog posts. His original idea to focus on Ethereum came after a friend convinced him to begin researching and understanding the protocol in 2017. What Makes Uniswap Unique? Uniswap exists to create liquidity — and therefore trading and the value that trading provides — for the DeFi sphere. One of the major AMMs in operation at present, the protocol functions using a formula for automated exchange — X x Y = K. Founder Hayden Adams describes himself as the inventor of the particular implementation of the formula on Uniswap. Uniswap is not just a decentralized exchange; it attempts to solve the issues that platforms such as  EtherDelta  experienced with liquidity. By automating the process of market making, the protocol inceventizes activity by limiting risk and reducing costs for all parties. The mechanism also removes identity requirements for users, and technically anyone can create a liquidity pool for any pair of tokens. According to Uniswap, their governance token (UNI) was created in order to “officially enshrin[e] Uniswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.” Uniswap V2 launched on Nov. 2, 2018, and introduced new features like ERC-20 pairs, price  oracles , flash swaps and more. The latest version — Uniswap V3, launched on the mainnet on May 5, 2021. It features greater capital efficiency for  liquidity providers , better execution for traders and enhanced infrastructure. Uniswap price reached an  all-time high  (ATH) of $44.97 leading up to the mainnet launch of V3. Since it’s launch there has been substantial interest in it’s  UNI to AUD  and  UNI to EUR  price pairs. Related Pages: Learn more about Balancer  here . Learn more about Curve  here .

The total supply of Uniswap’s governance token, UNI, is 1 billion units. These will become available over the course of four years, after which Uniswap will introduce a “perpetual inflation rate” of 2% to maintain network participation. Token distribution currently consists of the following: 60% to Uniswap community members, i.e. users, 21.51% to team members, 17.8% to investors and 0.69% to advisors. The latter three distributions will occur according to a four-year vesting schedule. Out of the majority set to go to users, 15% can be claimed by those who used Uniswap prior to Sep. 1, 2020. These even include users who submitted transactions which were never successful — they are eligible for 400 UNI. The UNI token serves the purpose of enabling shared community ownership in the growth and development of the decentralized protocol. This allows UNI holders to participate in the governance of the Uniswap protocol and wider ecosystem, in a neutral and trustless manner. The success and adoption of Uniswap products will positively impact Uniswap price, hence incentivizing token holders to contribute to the self-sustaining development of the ecosystem. Four years after the UNI token launch, in September 2024, a perpetual inflation rate of 2% annually will take effect. This is to ensure that participation in the Uniswap ecosystem continues, by disincentivizing passive holders. How Is the Uniswap Network Secured? Uniswap is a decentralized protocol for trading, and UNI is its in-house governance token. UNI is an  ERC-20  token, meaning it requires Ethereum to function. ERC-20 merely defines a set of rules for tokens, as well as security considerations mainly related to the strength of the Ethereum network. For example, congestion can hike the price of  gas  needed to perform transactions, leading to delays and abnormally high transaction fees, which impact all participants. Separately,  smart contracts  can cause security issues that could lead to DeFi traders losing funds; in fact, hackers have already succeeded in stealing millions of dollars in DeFi’s short lifetime as of September 2021. Where Can You Buy Uniswap (UNI)? Uniswap’s UNI governance token is available for trading on major exchanges against other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies and more. These include  Binance ,  Huobi  and  Coinbase Pro , along with, naturally, Uniswap’s protocol itself —  Uniswap (V2)  and  Uniswap (V3) .

Ocean Protocol is down 13.17% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #132, with a live market cap of $639,361,929 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 613,099,141 OCEAN coins   and a max. supply of 1,410,000,000 OCEAN coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Ocean Protocol , the top exchanges for trading in  Ocean Protocol  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   CoinTiger ,   KuCoin ,    and   Bitget .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)? Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based ecosystem that allows individuals and businesses to easily unlock the value of their data and monetize it through the use of  ERC-20  based datatokens.  Through Ocean Protocol, publishers can monetize their data while preserving privacy and control, whereas consumers can now access datasets that were previously unavailable or difficult to find. These datasets can be discovered on the Ocean Market, where they can be purchased and later consumed or sold. On Ocean Protocol, each data service is represented by a unique datatoken, which is used to wrap a dataset or compute-to-data service — this essentially allows third-parties to perform operations on the data without it ever leaving the secure enclave of the publisher.  OCEAN is a utility token that is used for community governance and  staking  on data, in addition to buying and selling data as the basic unit of exchange on the Ocean Market. The price of these datatokens is set by an OCEAN-datatoken  AMM  pool, which adjusts the price of the datatoken as it is bought and sold based on supply and demand.  Who Are the Founders of Ocean Protocol? Ocean Protocol was co-founded in 2017 by an experienced group of consultants and entrepreneurs, who together have a wealth of experience in developing and growing high tech businesses.  The Ocean Protocol core team includes: Bruce Pon, an experienced international project manager and current CEO of BigchainDB; Trent McConaghy, an experienced engineer and AI expert; Cristina Pon, marketing director at both Ocean Protocol and BigchainDB; and Razvan Olteanu, who has more than 20 years of technical and management experience in senior roles.  The Ocean Protocol core team is currently composed of 15 individuals, and the platform is supported by a massive list of advisors — many of which are experts in AI,  blockchain , big data and business, and have developed and managed their own successful companies. What Makes Ocean Protocol Unique? Ocean Protocol unlocks access to data that would previously be unavailable or challenging to access, by allowing anybody with sought-after datasets to tokenize their data and make it available on the Ocean Market.  This produces an additional income stream for data publishers while giving scientists, researchers, data analysts and anybody else access to more reliable data.  Ocean Protocol provides the tools needed for firms to build and launch their own data markets, by either directly forking the Ocean Protocol, or by using the supplied Ocean Protocol React hooks. It also provides extensive documentation to assist with this process. Holders of OCEAN tokens can directly participate in the datatoken economy by staking their tokens on datasets on the Ocean Market. Stakers then become l iquidity providers  in the selected OCEAN-datatoken pool, and earn a fraction of the transaction fees generated by the pool.

How Many Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) Coins Are There in Circulation? As of November 2020, a total of 414 million OCEAN tokens are currently in circulation. This is out of a fixed maximum of 1.41 billion tokens, which was set in the new Ocean contract deployed on August 21, 2020. It will take a total of 50 years for the full OCEAN supply to be released, whereas a total of ~600 million tokens are expected to be in circulation by May 2022, and 1 billion tokens by January 2031. Of the total Ocean supply, 20% is allocated to the project founders, 15% to acquirors (SAFTE purchasers), 5% to the Ocean Protocol Foundation and the remaining 60% will be distributed to keepers (those that run Ocean network nodes). How Is the Ocean Protocol Network Secured? OCEAN is currently an ERC-20 token operating on the  Ethereum  blockchain. As a result, it is backed by Ethereum’s extensive  proof-of-work  (POW) mining and node network, which protect it against a variety of  attacks .  Ocean Protocol previously operated on a proof-of-authority (PoA) sidechain, but this was scrapped to ensure datatokens remain compatible with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.  According to a 2019  blog entry , Ocean Protocol applied military-grade security practices when designing its smart contracts — ensuring they can be securely upgraded and deployed without opening up any attack vectors.  Where Can You Buy Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)? Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) tokens can currently be traded on more than two dozen exchanges, including several top tier platforms — like Binance, KuCoin, Bittrex and Poloniex. As of November 2020,  Binance  is the most liquid centralized exchange for OCEAN, whereas  Uniswap  is the most liquid decentralized exchange for OCEAN.  OCEAN currently cannot be purchased directly with fiat currencies on any supported exchanges. But you can  buy Bitcoin with fiat  instead, and then exchange this to OCEAN.

Tether is up 0.02% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #4, with a live market cap of $71,079,927,327 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 71,045,760,761 USDT coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Tether , the top exchanges for trading in  Tether  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Tether (USDT)? USDT is a  stablecoin  (stable-value cryptocurrency) that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by a Hong Kong-based company Tether. The token’s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, cash, reserve repo notes, and treasury bills in reserves that is equal in USD value to the number of USDT in circulation. Originally launched in July 2014 as Realcoin, a second-layer cryptocurrency token built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain through the use of the Omni platform, it was later renamed to USTether, and then, finally, to USDT. In addition to Bitcoin’s, USDT was later updated to work on the  Ethereum ,  EOS ,  Tron ,  Algorand , and  OMG  blockchains. The stated purpose of USDT is to combine the unrestricted nature of cryptocurrencies — which can be sent between users without a trusted third-party intermediary — with the stable value of the US dollar. Who Are The Founders Of Tether? USDT — or as it was known at the time, Realcoin — was launched in 2014 by Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins and Craig Sellars. Brock Pierce is a well-known entrepreneur who has co-founded a number of high-profile projects in the crypto and entertainment industries. In 2013, he co-founded a venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, which by 2017 had raised over $80 million in funding. In 2014, Pierce became the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit established to help improve and promote Bitcoin. Pierce has also co-founded Block.one, the company behind EOS, one of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market. Reeve Collins was the CEO of Tether for the first two years of its existence. Prior to that, he had co-founded several successful companies, such as the online ad network Traffic Marketplace, entertainment studio RedLever and gambling website Pala Interactive. As of 2020, Collins is heading SmarMedia Technologies, a marketing and advertising tech company. Other than working on Tether, Craig Sellars has been a member of the Omni Foundation for over six years. Its Omni Protocol allows users to create and trade smart-contract based properties and currencies on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Sellars has also worked in several other cryptocurrency companies and organizations, such as Bitfinex, Factom, Synereo and the MaidSafe Foundation. What Makes Tether Unique? USDT’s unique feature is the fact that its value is guaranteed by Tether to remain pegged to the U.S. dollar. According to Tether, whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its reserves, thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents. The famously high volatility of the crypto markets means that cryptocurrencies can rise or fall by 10-20% within a single day, making them unreliable as a store of value. USDT, on the other hand, is protected from these fluctuations. This property makes USDT a safe haven for crypto investors: during periods of high volatility, they can park their portfolios in Tether without having to completely cash out into USD. In addition, USDT provides a simple way to transact a U.S. dollar equivalent between regions, countries and even continents via blockchain — without having to rely on a slow and expensive intermediary, like a bank or a financial services provider. However, over the years, there have been a number of controversies regarding the validity of Tether’s claims about their USD reserves, at times disrupting USDT’s price, which went down as low as $0.88 at one point in its history. Many have raised concerns about the fact that Tether’s reserves have never been fully audited by an independent third party. Related Pages : Looking for market and blockchain data for BTC? Visit our  block explorer . Want to buy crypto? Use CoinMarketCap’s  guide . How Many Tether (USDT) Coins Are There In Circulation? There is no hard-coded limit on the total supply of USDT — given the fact that it belongs to a private company, theoretically, its issuance is limited only by Tether’s own policies. However, because Tether claims that every single USDT is supposed to be backed by one U.S. dollar, the amount of tokens is limited by the company’s actual cash reserves. Moreover, Tether does not disclose its issuance schedules ahead of time. Instead, they provide daily transparency reports, listing the total amount of their asset reserves and liabilities, the latter corresponding to the amount of USDT in circulation. As of September 2020, there are over 14.4 billion USDT tokens in circulation, which are backed by $14.6 billion in assets, according to Tether. How Is the Tether Network Secured? USDT does not have its own blockchain — instead, it operates as a second-layer token on top of other cryptocurrencies’ blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash and OMG, and is secured by their respective hashing algorithms. Where Can You Buy Tether (USDT)? It is possible to  buy Tether  / USDT on a large number of cryptocurrency exchanges. In fact, USDT’s average daily trading volume is often on par or even exceeds that of Bitcoin. It is especially prominent on those exchanges where fiat-to-crypto trading pairs are unavailable, as it provides a viable alternative to USD.

It offers a framework for smart contracts which provides developers with an easy and effective way to code on Ethereum, while also leveraging the POA Network capabilities. Who Are the Founders of xDai?  The founder of xDai (STAKE) is Igor Barinov.

Users can participate in chain consensus and stake their xDai to secure the chain and receive rewards.  Two bridges connect the xDai Stable Chain to the Ethereum mainnet that supports seamless two-way asset transfer between the chains. The tokens are acquired on the mainnet and then bridged to the xDai sidechain through the usage of the DAI-xDai bridge for transaction tokens; the OmniBridge is used for cross-chain transfers.  It is important to note that xDai runs on the public POSDAO consensus and delegated proof-of-stake and anyone with enough STAKE to run a node can become a validator.

DRC mobility is up 2.06% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #6606, with a live market cap of not available.   The circulating supply is not available   and a max. supply of 1,000,000,000 DRC coins. DRC unifies all automotive service areas and mobility markets through a blockchain platform based on reliable smart data.  The automotive industry has achieved remarkable growth over the past 100 years and has become a tool and asset comparable to food, clothing, and shelter. In recent years, a new service that combines the traditional automobile industry and IT technology has emerged, and it is moving toward a platform business model that combines a new sharing culture that borrows when needed rather than owning. With the introduction of autonomous vehicles and eco-friendly electric vehicle technologies, etc. Seems to grow even further. However, the automobile industry and newly emerging IT services are in charge of only a specific service area, and there is a limit that cannot connect the entire automotive ecosystem into one. Excessive bleeding competition, irrationality in pricing decisions, and thorough verification and compensation, including distrust of quality and price. Because of the lack of a system, a vicious cycle is becoming more and more solidified throughout the automotive service industry. DRC operates a variety of IT services in the automotive industry, such as providing advertising/marketing solutions, developing application software, and car rental based on a vehicle sharing platform with domestic partners, and continuing to think about how to solve problems in the automotive ecosystem. came. The conclusion that I have made while continuing to think about how to solve the problems of the automotive ecosystem is that if a number of companies and users are connected to a single blockchain-based automotive service ecosystem, fundamental problems in the automotive market that have not been solved before can be improved and solved. And it is our mission and future vision to connect numerous services into one DRC ecosystem (DRC ECO) through the convergence of blockchain technology and car services based on a vehicle sharing platform. By providing life-friendly projects linked to real life in the easiest and fastest way, it provides a quick and fast market entry environment for both mobility operators and users, and encourages participation in the ecosystem through various benefits and rewards.

Dymmax is a novel protocol aiming to build a decentralized platform for options emission and secondary circulation. Dymmax is based on a well-studied parimutuel model, allowing to issue options without a seller. Buyers of various option types (PUT, CALL, IRONFLY) form a joint bank, which is guaranteed to be sufficient for expiration payments. The price of every option type is calculated off-chain when all bets are done for maximum auction efficiency. All matched orders are tokenized in the form of ERC-20 tokens, providing a way for the secondary market. New at-the-money optionsсобе with the same expiration day are issued every day, supplementing existing supply and increasing liquidity.

We update our RENBTC to USD price in real-time.   renBTC is up 0.67% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #103, with a live market cap of $1,064,424,856 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 16,811 RENBTC coins   and a max. supply of 13,698 RENBTC coins. If you would like to know where to buy  renBTC , the top exchanges for trading in  renBTC  are currently  Binance ,   Gate.io ,   Raydium ,   Honeyswap ,    and   Bittrex .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is RenBTC (RENBTC)? RenBTC  is an  ERC-20  token built on the Ethereum network, pegged to  Bitcoin . This means that each RENBTC can be always redeemed for one Bitcoin, and hence tends to maintain its value at close to the Bitcoin market rate.  RenBTC is minted on the Ren platform, which is an open protocol that provides everyone with access to the inter-blockchain  liquidity , helping to bring assets from other  blockchains  to Ethereum decentralized applications ( DApps ). The main cryptocurrencies supported are Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Zcash (ZEC).  The renBTC token is a direct competitor of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). Minting the token is a fairly straightforward process, which sees users simply send their BTC to RenVM, which then secures the asset and mints an equivalent number of renBTC tokens on  Ethereum .  Unlike other Bitcoin-backed tokens, renBTC is not a synthetic token, and doesn’t rely on any liquidation mechanisms to ensure it remains pegged to the value of BTC — instead, it’s a direct supply peg, meaning there are always enough BTC in reserve to cover the circulating renBTC supply.  Redeeming renBTC is just as simple as minting it. The user only needs to send their renBTC back to RenVM (paying a small gas fee to do so) which releases the native Bitcoin to the user’s address. The renBTC tokens are destroyed, reducing the supply to match the reduced reserves. Who Are the Founders of RenBTC (RENBTC)? Ren (formerly Republic Protocol) — the development firm behind the Ren ecosystem was founded by Taiyang Zhang, who is also its current CEO.  Zhang was also a founding member of KeeperDAO and is one of the co-founders of Virgil Capital — a multi-strategy quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm. He is a skilled developer and early cryptocurrency adopter. The Ren team also includes Loong Wang, the current CTO of Ren. Wang was the lead software developer for Neucode, and also holds the position of academic tutor at the Australian National University. The rest of the team includes three more software developers, one blockchain developer, a researcher, and currently comprises more than 30 individuals.  What Makes RenBTC Unique?  The main difference between renBTC and other wrapped Bitcoin tokens is the fluid value exchange of the token. RenVM does not store any Bitcoin inside a centralized custodial platform but instead uses a decentralized network of nodes called Darknodes. Users can mint and burn tokens back and forth whenever they want, without needing to complete KYC to do so. The protocol can handle hundreds of transactions per minute, and has never been overloaded. Additionally, RenVM can be directly integrated into numerous decentralized applications through the use of specialized adapters provided by Ren. This means that a user can directly utilize Bitcoin (via RENBTC) on a decentralized exchange ( DEX ) or lending platform without needing to jump through any hoops first.  It’s also important to note that the ECDSA private keys of RenVM are secret which creates a trustless, decentralized, and permissionless BTC token on the Ethereum network.

Take a look at  WETH (WETH)  — an ERC-20 compliant version of Ethereum (ETH), Learn how to use Uniswap with  CoinMarketCap Alexandria . For the latest news, market updates, tricks, and tips, check out the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many RenBTC (RENBTC) Coins Are There in Circulation? The total supply and circulating supply of RenBTC are the same and fluctuate as ERC-20 renBTC tokens are minted and burned. The token did not have a token sale, and there is no team allocation of RENBTC. As of December 2020, there are just north of 14,000 BTC wrapped as RENBTC, bringing its market capitalization to $321.9 million. Note that this is likely to change considerably over time, as the market capitalization of renBTC depends both on the underlying value of Bitcoin (BTC), and the number of BTC held in the renBTC reserve.  How Is the RenBTC protocol Secured? RenBTC operates on top of the Ethereum network — one of the most secure blockchains in current usage. The  ERC-20  RenBTC tokens are secured by the collective efforts of thousands of Ethereum miners, who act to maintain the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain and the tokens transferred on it.  Additionally, the RenVM protocol utilizes a secure multiparty computation system that allows untrusted Darknodes to run scripts without revealing the input or output to others. Darknodes must stake 100,000 REN tokens as collateral and earn fees for helping to power the renBTC network.  The ECDSA private keys are hidden, even from the nodes, which means that RenVM generates and signs data in a secure manner. No  attacker  can prevent other users from minting their renBTC or redeeming their BTC back whenever they choose. The protocol claims to be  Byzantine Fault Tolerant  which means that even if the Darknodes become unavailable or act fraudulently, the scripts will continue running to keep the secrets hidden. Where Can You Buy RenBTC (RENBTC)? Users can always obtain RenBTC by minting it on the RenVM protocol using any Bitcoin they already have. However, the ERC-20 renBTC token can be purchased directly on several popular exchanges including  Binance  and  Huobi Global , in addition to various decentralized exchanges — including Uniswap and 1inch Exchange.  As of December 2020, the most popular renBTC trading pairs are renBTC/BTC, renBTC/WETH, and renBTC/USDT. There are currently no direct fiat on-ramps to renBTC, but you can buy Bitcoin with fiat ( as explained here ), and then convert it to renBTC via the RenVM platform.

The FIO token is the native utility token of the project's blockchain infrastructure, FIO Chain, and is used for transaction gas fees and on-chain governance. The FIO Chain uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) to achieve network consensus. Block Producers are elected by FIO token holders via on-chain voting. Anyone can register to become a BP and produce blocks if they receive enough votes.  FIO addresses act as a human-readable wallet identifier (username@domain) for users on the FIO Protocol. The registration of a FIO Address can be done through a FIO-integrated application or through a registration site. A FIO Address has a yearly fee in FIO tokens, and is bonded with 100 free transactions. FIO Request allows users to initiate transactions using FIO Addresses. This request is stored onchain, with metadata (e.g. currency, amount) encrypted using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. FIO Data is transaction metadata. This metadata can range from a free-form memo to structured data (e.g. deposit details). The team envisages FIO Data as a means to support decentralized commerce, where transactiond data (e.g. invoices, dates) can be stored on-chain. FIO Data can also include blockchain metadata, such as transaction.

Launched in December 2020, the project and token are the brainchild of Steve Wozniak, co-founder of computing giant Apple. The principal aim of Efforce is to democratize the energy efficiency industry, which to this day suffers from teething problems with financing and global outreach. WOZX tokens function as the medium through which energy savings created on the Efforce platform are tokenized for use by any participant. Who Are the Founders of Efforce? As the EFFORCE token’s ticker name suggests, the main personality associated with Efforce is Steve Wozniak, the IT mogul known the world over for co-founding Apple with Steve Jobs. Wozniak has stated that even at that time, one of his major goals was to improve energy efficiency in emerging technologies, with Apple set to focus on smaller, more efficient machines. Efforce continues that ethos, with an official press release at launch describing the product as the “first decentralized platform that allows everyone to participate and benefit financially from worldwide energy efficiency projects, and create meaningful environmental change.” The company’s other three co-founders — Jacopo Visetti, Jacopo Vanetti and Andrea Castiglione — have more than a decade of experience in the energy efficiency industry. What Makes Efforce Unique? As co-founder Visetti states, Efforce’s core business proposition is to allow participants to make money while developing and contributing to environment-saving energy efficiency initiatives. A form of marketplace for the industry, Efforce aims to draw together those market participants and use decentralized technology to smooth out issues with the current energy efficiency ecosystem. Blockchain , for example, will be used to record real energy saving achievements, these then being awarded as credits in megawatt hours for sale or consumption.  Efforce also acts as a consultant, guiding projects through the various stages of development and funding while using the platform. The WOZX token goes a step further towards introducing the industry to cryptographic technology and decentralized payments. Growth in demand is all but guaranteed, the company says, as the International Energy Agency's Efficient World Scenario calls for the energy efficiency sector to hit $580 billion in investments by 2025. As of 2020, the tally is at $250 billion. Related Pages: Read more about Energy Web Token (EWT)  here . Read more about Power Ledger (POWR)  here . Crypto newbie? Find the answers to all your questions with  Alexandria , CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource. How Many EFFORCE (WOZX) Coins Are There in Circulation? The EFFORCE (WOZX) token is a fixed-cap  ERC-20  standard cryptocurrency on Ethereum for use and trade in tandem with the Efforce energy efficiency platform.  100 million WOZX were created at launch, supply to remain fixed at 100% of the original allocation. Of the 100 million, 45% of the tokens will be allocated via a private placement. 20% went to Efforce itself, another 20% towards mining incentives and the remaining 15% for ecosystem and consulting activities. Token holders will receive a minimum of 1% of the total energy savings from successful projects, distributed among all investors. Holders will also be able to use their investments for voting rights as part of system governance, according to the Efforce whitepaper. How Is the Efforce Network Secured? Efforce uses an incentive scheme to encourage network participants to secure and support it, in common with many similar corporate blockchain token setups. Mining occurs once a successful project launches on Efforce, the whitepaper explains, with any token rewards set to be issued on a sliding scale over a ten-year period.  This helps to ensure continued interaction and liquidity as the company expands and the value of the token notionally rises. Where Can You Buy EFFORCE (WOZX)? EFFORCE (WOZX) is a brand new cryptocurrency token as of December 2020, and as such is tradable in an increasing but limited number of venues. The first major exchange to list WOZX was  HBTC , and it is likely that more major exchanges will follow. HBTC offers  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Tether  (USDT) trading pairs for WOZX.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Aave (AAVE)? Aave is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow crypto. Lenders earn interest by depositing digital assets into specially created liquidity pools. Borrowers can then use their crypto as collateral to take out a flash loan using this liquidity. Aave (which means “ghost” in Finnish) was originally known as ETHLend when it launched in November 2017, but the rebranding to Aave happened in September 2018. (This helps explain why this token’s ticker is so different from its name!) AAVE provides holders with discounted fees on the platform, and it also serves as a governance token — giving owners a say in the future development of the protocol. Who Are the Founders of Aave? Aave, and its predecessor ETHLend, were founded by Stani Kulechov. At the time, he was frustrated at the lack of lending applications on Ethereum — and his project was built before  decentralized finance  even existed. Kulechov is a serial entrepreneur who went to law school and began programming when he was a teenager. He was an early adopter in the blockchain space. The CEO has said that he wanted to rebrand ETHLend as Aave so the company could offer a wider range of services beyond Ether lending. According to Kulechov, Aave’s main target market are people who are already engaged in the cryptocurrency community. What Makes Aave Unique? Aave has several unique selling points when compared with competitors in an increasingly crowded market. During the  DeFi craze  in the summer of 2020, it was one of the biggest projects in terms of the total value of crypto locked in its protocol. The project allows people to borrow and lend in about 20 cryptocurrencies, meaning that users have a greater amount of choice. One of Aave’s flagship products are “flash loans,” which have been billed as the first uncollateralized loan option in the DeFi space. There’s a catch: they must be paid back within the same transaction. Another big selling point is how those who borrow through Aave can alternate between fixed and variable interest rates. While fixed rates can provide some certainty about costs during times of volatility in the crypto markets, variable rates can come in handy if the borrower thinks that prices will fall in the near future.

Circulation is linked to the total value locked on Aave, as tokens are burned whenever the protocol gathers fees. An  initial coin offering  was held in November 2017, where $16.2 million was raised by selling one billion AAVE tokens at a rate equivalent to $0.0162 a piece. At the time, 23% of AAVE tokens were assigned to its founders and project. AAVE tokens have been built based on the  ERC-20  standard, and they are designed to be deflationary. In the event of a shortfall in the DeFi protocol, staked tokens would be used as collateral as a last resort. In July 2020, Aave unveiled plans to hold a token swap. This means that the 1.3 billion AAVE tokens in circulation would be swapped for the newly minted AAVE cryptocurrency at a ratio of 1:100, creating a total supply of 16 million AAVE. (Three million of this would be held in reserve.) How Is the Aave Network Secured? Aave’s open-source protocol is built on  Ethereum , a blockchain that is currently making the transition from  Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake . Where Can You Buy Aave (AAVE)?

SushiSwap is up 0.88% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #80, with a live market cap of $1,611,854,738 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 127,244,443 SUSHI coins   and a max. supply of 250,000,000 SUSHI coins.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is SushiSwap (SUSHI)? SushiSwap (SUSHI) is an example of an automated market maker ( AMM ). An increasingly popular tool among cryptocurrency users, AMMs are decentralized exchanges which use smart contracts to create markets for any given pair of tokens. SushiSwap launched in September 2020 as a fork of  Uniswap , the AMM which has become synonymous with the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) movement and associated trading boom in DeFi tokens. SushiSwap aims to diversify the AMM market and also  add additional features  not previously present on Uniswap, such as increased rewards for network participants via its in-house token, SUSHI. Who Are the Founders of SushiSwap? SushiSwap was founded by the pseudonymous entity known only as  Chef Nomi . Little is known about Chef Nomi, or his or her impetus for forking off from Uniswap. The project has two other pseudonymous co-founders, sushiswap and 0xMaki, also known as just Maki. Between them, they handle SushiSwap’s code, product development and business operations. More recently, de facto ownership of SushiSwap was passed to Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of derivatives exchange  FTX  and quantitative trading startup Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried is a well-known participant and cryptocurrency market commentator, regularly appearing in media interviews.  What Makes SushiSwap Unique? SushiSwap primarily exists as an AMM, through which automated trading liquidity is set up between any two cryptocurrency assets. Its main audience is DeFi traders and associated entities looking to capitalize on the boom in project tokens and create liquidity. AMMs do away with order books entirely while avoiding problems such as liquidity issues, which hamper traditional decentralized exchanges. SushiSwap aims to improve on the offerings of its parent, Uniswap, by increasing the impact users can have on its operations and future.  The platform takes a 0.3% cut from transactions occurring in its liquidity pools, while its SUSHI token is used to reward users portions of those fees. SUSHI also entitles users to governance rights.  Related Pages: Learn more about Uniswap’s distribution on the CMC blog  here . New to DeFi? Learn more about it  here . Cryptocurrency newbie? Check out  Alexandria , CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education suite. How Many SushiSwap (SUSHI) Coins Are There in Circulation? SushiSwap’s in-house token SUSHI is created at a rate of 100 tokens per block. The first 100,000 blocks had a block reward of 1,000 SUSHI. The supply of SUSHI will depend on the block rate. At approximately 6,500 per day, and therefore 650,000 newly-minted tokens per day, there will be roughly 326 million tokens in circulation by September 2021, a year after SushiSwap first launched. SUSHI had no premine, and began to be minted at  Ethereum  block number 10,750,000, beginning with a supply of zero tokens. How Is SushiSwap Network Secured? SushiSwap attempts to mitigate the traditional risks of depositing funds in smart contracts by upping the governance powers of its users. The anonymity of its developers poses questions beyond a technical standpoint. In September 2020, for example, Chef Nomi was involved in a spat with users after withdrawing 38,000 in Ethereum (ETH) from SushiSwap. The funds were subsequently returned, with Chef Nomi publicly apologizing for doing so and calling the move a mistake. Where Can You Buy SushiSwap (SUSHI)? SushiSwap (SUSHI) is a freely-tradable token, with the majority of volume on major exchanges occurring on  Binance ,  Huobi Global  and  OKEx . Pairs against other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are active, as well as with fiat, including on Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. New to cryptocurrency?

  "content": "AMPL Price Live Data The live  Ampleforth price today  is $1.79 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $12,501,174 USD.   We update our AMPL to USD price in real-time.   Ampleforth is up 1.25% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #195, with a live market cap of $282,315,344 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 157,999,835 AMPL coins   and a max. supply of 395,345,189 AMPL coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Ampleforth , the top exchanges for trading in  Ampleforth  are currently  FTX ,   KuCoin ,   Gate.io ,   Bitfinex ,    and   MEXC .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Ampleforth (AMPL)? Ampleforth is an  Ethereum -based cryptocurrency with an algorithmically adjusted circulating supply. It is designed to be the base money of the new decentralized economy, by providing an asset that cannot be diluted by supply inflation and remains decoupled to the price action of other cryptocurrencies—and  Bitcoin (BTC)  in particular.  With Ampleforth, token holders own a fixed fraction of the total AMPL circulating supply, rather than a fixed number of tokens. When the protocol detects that the price of AMPL is too high, it increases the circulating supply, whereas the supply is decreased if the price is too low.  This change is propagated to all Ampleforth wallets, which have their wallet balance adjusted proportionally. Irrespective of this change, AMPL holders will still retain the same percentage of the token supply.  This automatic supply adjustment process is known as a “rebase” and occurs once each day, with a positive rebase if the price goes above $1.06, and a negative rebase if it is below $0.96. The overall goal of the system is to create incentives that drive the market price of AMPL back to ~$1.  Who Are the Founders of Ampleforth? Ampleforth was founded by Evan Kuo, an experienced product manager and serial entrepreneur that holds a bachelor of science (BS) in mechatronics, robotics and automation engineering from UC Berkeley. Kuo is described as an art and math lover, and has experience developing predictive auction products. He previously held the role of CEO at Pythagoras Pizza — a San Francisco-based pizza delivery service, but now holds the role of CEO at the Ampleforth Foundation — the development and management firm behind the Ampleforth protocol.  Besides Kuo, the Ampleforth Foundation team is almost entirely composed of engineers and includes ex-Uber and ex-Google senior software engineer Brandon Iles, who is also listed as co-founder of the project. As per its  LinkedIn page , Ampleforth currently lists just over a dozen team members, the vast majority of which operate in the San Francisco Bay Area.  What Makes Ampleforth Unique? Ampleforth is unique in that it aims to provide a truly non-correlated asset that can be used for diversifying cryptocurrency portfolios, as a reserve collateral for decentralized finance ( DeFi ) applications and eventually as an alternative to central-bank money that is resistant to shocks.  Ampleforth achieves this by using an entirely new system, which sees the circulating supply expand and contract in response to consumer demand, without diluting any individual stakeholder. Ampleforth believes that this property makes it suited as a new type of base money for the digital economy — similar to how gold was previously used as the base money to many fiat currencies prior to the dissolution of the Bretton Woods agreement.  Because the Ampleforth supply is unaffected by inflation or any other dilutive factors, it is uniquely positioned as an asset that is able to maintain its purchasing power against other assets. This makes it attractive as a hedge and as an alternative to fiat currencies suffering from rampant devaluation.

Unlike the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, Ampleforth does not have a fixed minimum or maximum supply. Instead, the number of AMPL tokens in circulation will continue to grow if the price stays above $1, whereas it will continue to shrink if it is below $1. In addition to several private investment rounds, Ampleforth raised $4.9 million in an initial exchange offering (IEO) launched on Tokinex. As part of this sale, AMPL tokens were sold at $0.98 each.  Ampleforth initially launched with a circulating supply of 50 million tokens. According to the original  transparency report , these tokens were allocated as follows: 23.2% to the ecosystem; 18.5% to seed investors; 3.3% to series A investors; 10% to Tokinex IEO participants; 25% to the Ampleforth team and advisors; and 20% to the treasury. As per a more  recent report  (August 2020), the most notable changes to the supply distribution include ~42.5% of AMPL is now held by the community, while 23.5% is allocated to liquidity mining programs.  How Is the Ampleforth Network Secured? As an  ERC-20  token, Ampleforth is built on top of the Ethereum  blockchain , and benefits from the strength and security that comes with its extensive node and miner network.  Beyond this, the integrity of the Ampleforth network is maintained by a decentralized network of  oracles , which are used to feed in the price data used to determine whether there needs to be a positive or negative rebase.  Until December 2019, Ampleforth was previously the only oracle provider used to source market data, but it has since integrated Chainlink oracles for the same purpose — helping to avoid the centralization of oracle data. Now, data from multiple aggregators is used in the logic behind the rebase function.  Where Can You Buy Ampleforth (AMPL)? Ampleforth tokens, sometimes known simply as amples, can be purchased and traded on well over a dozen cryptocurrency platforms against both other cryptocurrencies and fiat assets. As it stands,  KuCoin  is the most popular centralized exchange for AMPL, whereas  Uniswap  is the most popular decentralized exchange for AMPL.

  "content": "What Is Cosmos (ATOM)?  In a nutshell, Cosmos bills itself as a project that solves some of the “hardest problems” facing the blockchain industry. It aims to offer an antidote to “slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful”  proof-of-work  protocols, like those used by Bitcoin, by offering an ecosystem of connected blockchains. The project’s other goals include making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers thanks to a modular framework that demystifies decentralized apps. Last but not least, an Interblockchain Communication protocol makes it easier for blockchain networks to communicate with each other — preventing fragmentation in the industry. Cosmos’ origins can be dated back to 2014, when Tendermint, a core contributor to the network, was founded. In 2016, a white paper for Cosmos was published — and a token sale was held the following year. ATOM tokens are earned through a hybrid proof-of-stake algorithm, and they help to keep the Cosmos Hub, the project’s flagship blockchain, secure. This cryptocurrency also has a role in the network’s governance. Who Are the Founders of Cosmos? The co-founders of Tendermint — the gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem — were Jae Kwon, Zarko Milosevic and Ethan Buchman. Although Kwon is still listed as principal architect, he stepped down as CEO in 2020. He maintains he is still a part of the project but is mainly focusing on other initiatives. He has now been replaced as Tendermint’s CEO by Peng Zhong, and the whole board of directors was given quite a substantial refresh. Their goals include enhancing the experience for developers, creating an enthusiastic community for Cosmos and building educational resources so greater numbers of people are aware of what this network is capable of. What Makes Cosmos Unique? \n A major concern for some in the crypto industry centers on the levels of fragmentation seen in blockchain networks. There are hundreds in existence, but very few of them can communicate with each other. Cosmos aims to turn this on its head by making this possible. Cosmos is described as “Blockchain 3.0” — and as we mentioned earlier, a big goal is ensuring that its infrastructure is straightforward to use. To this end, the Cosmos software development kit focuses on modularity. This allows a network to be easily built using chunks of code that already exist. Long-term, it’s hoped that complex applications will be straightforward to construct as a result.  Scalability is another priority, meaning substantially more transactions can be processed a second than more old-fashioned blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If blockchains are to ever achieve mainstream adoption, they’ll need to be able to cope with demand as well as existing payment processing companies or websites — or be even better. Check out simple definitions for crypto terms in our glossary Learn about blockchain basics with CMC Alexandria Read the latest features in our blog How Many Cosmos (ATOM) Coins Are There in Circulation? ATOM has a very specific total supply — 260,906,513 to be exact. Of these, at the time of writing, about 203,121,910 were in circulation. It is worth noting that these cryptocurrencies aren’t mined — instead, they are earned through  staking . Two private sales were held in January 2017, followed by a public sale in April of that year. This raised a total of $16 million, which is the equivalent of about $0.10 per ATOM. Breaking down the token distribution, about 80% was allocated to investors, while the remaining 20% was split between two companies: All In Bits and the Interchain Foundation. Cosmos has compared ATOM tokens to the ASICs that are used to mine Bitcoin. As a technical paper written by the Tendermint team explained: “It is a piece of virtualized hardware (economic capital) that you need to obtain in order to participate as a keeper in the network.” How Is the Cosmos Network Secured? As we mentioned earlier, Cosmos uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Validator nodes that stake a higher quantity of ATOM tokens are more likely to be chosen to verify transactions and earn rewards. Nodes that are found to be acting dishonestly are penalized — and they can end up losing the tokens that they had at stake. Where Can You Buy Cosmos (ATOM)? It is now available across a number of major exchanges — many people choose to  buy Cosmos  on Binance, Coinbase and OKEx.

The circulating supply is not available   and a max. supply of 100,000,000 TLB coins. ''What Is The Luxury Coin (TLB)? Private Luxury Membership Supported By a New Purpose-Built Cryptocurrency Utility Token\nThis is the fusion of Exclusive Luxury Membership with the latest technology in the financial industry. The TLB is a class of Cryptocurrency designated as a ‘Utility Token’. The TLB has value within The Luxury Network, allowing users to gain access to special events, unique Experiences, , participate in auctions, or benefit from the financial services offered by The Luxury Bank. The Luxury is the project that wants to make spending crypto as easy as a credit card. Creators of the TLB token hope that it will one day be used on their Binance-based Point-of-Sale devices. One of the most notorious pain points in crypto is the ability to actually make purchases. TLB cryptocurrency plans to change all that by distributing thousands of point-of-sale smart devices to luxury retailers so they can accept payment in the form of TLB, the network’s proprietary crypto token. If it can distribute the devices for free and with lower transaction fees than current card and mobile payment solutions provide, it’s a grand-slam idea. Roadmap The company is working on developing a card, which they are naming The Luxury Card, which will work together with the mobile app and wallet, enabling payments and deposits by card (a familiar medium for most) that are pulled from the mobile wallet. In addition, users should be able to see the current market price of each cryptocurrency before paying for goods and services, allowing them to pay with the cryptocurrency that brings the best value at the time. This ability to pay for things easily with cryptocurrencies is what will finally give them real value in a widespread sense. Who Are the Founders of The Luxury Coin (TLB)? The Luxury team are a talented group of technologists and entrepreneurs, which seems to be exactly what this project will need for success. The President of The Luxury, Catalin Dascalu, has a long history of founding successful luxury companies, and scaling them, which makes him an ideal fit for a project that will need rapid growth and adoption. The CTO/COO Samer Fatoum, created and sold his first business by the age of 35 and went on to create and sell several more business, including one that had over 50 employees.  The Luxury has taken on an impressive and ambitious task in tackling what could amount to everyday adoption of cryptocurrencies by the masses, if their vision is realized. The technology seems appropriate for what they’re attempting, and the delivery of the first 100 POS devices is a target that the team wants to reach in 2021\" Here are some other articles that you may be interested in: What Is a Crypto Faucet?

MicroBitcoin is down 0.88% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #1740, with a live market cap of $1,464,474 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 47,958,344,687 MBC coins   and a max. supply of 61,000,000,000 MBC coins. What is MicroBitcoin (MBC)?\nMicrobitcoin is a decentralized peer-2-peer (P2P) payment protocol for the micro-economy. It is hard forked from Bitcoin on 525 000-th block number. It saves all originally described in a 2008 fatures of original Bitcoin, but pushes it further to improve and surpass it. MBC is intended to be a user-friendly cryptocurrency, that can't be said about Bitcoin due to its current price and incredibly high transaction fees. As every of as can see, this led Bitcoin to its limitation about application for micro-payments because of the problems of scalability, slow transaction times and high transaction costs. MicroBitcoin strives to solve this problem and at the same time not lose the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto. So we have designed MicroBitcoin that is 10,000 times the total supply of Bitcoin which is of the lower unit price. However, in order to embody this faster transaction speed had to be implemented, and many difficulties including lower fees as well as high rewards for mining had to be faced. Thanks to various contributors all around the world such as Korea, the US, and Ukraine, we have now realized the policies for speed, transaction fees, and reward, and the coin has been developed. In addition, we have completed the coin to be usable in micro-economy through thorough security by implementing the new encryption algorithm, LWMA-3, for the first time in the world. We aims to Microbitcoin be used so easy and simple as email these days. Try it and make sure of this straight now. Who are Founders?\nAs concept, MicroBitcoin currency does not belong to anyone, and we think this is what a cryptocurrency should be - not owned by anyone, but belongs to everyone. We hope that people who stumble upon this currency for the first time are able to absorb, think out and understand it. If so, MicroBitcoin will be able to settle down as a concept of an absolutely new currency. Everyone should understand: this signifies that no one can claim the authority of a creator and that it has to be the new form of payment through all participants who have and will contribute. The hardships of exclusivity\nDue to the fact that the coin is supported by community participants, and not a single person, many difficulties arise. Some participants leave, others come: some are delighted with the project, others are already disappointed. All of this stems from the principle of decentralization. As you can imagine, not every exchange can accept such rules. Therefore, it is very difficult for MBC to place himself on new crypto projects. But we know for sure, the community will work to solve this and other problems. And we are grateful to every exchange that accepted these conditions.  The Mining\nMicroBitcoin is ASIC-resistant, thanks to its Power2b Algorithm. MBC also have resistance to abnormal mining attempt to occupy majority of blocks. The world’s first-ever successful application among altcoin cryptocurrencies. It is mined only on CPU, forget about all that expensive equipment like ASIC or GPU, mine on your home machine. What's next?\nMBCians take effort not only to open the source code of MicroBitcoin but also to maintain the community for everyone to be able to join.MBCians believe that only transparent and decentralized processes can bring about the true real transparent and decentralized world. It is the reason why we think an open source community is so important. An open source project means that anybody can view, use, modify, distribute, and participate in the project. And so can you. In conclusion\nMicroBitcoin as the most realistic means of payment for the micro-economy bringing it one step closer to becoming the new currency of the future, as well as the technological breakthrough that will bring a great deal of real-world convenience.

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008  whitepaper  by a person, or group of people, using the alias  Satoshi Nakamoto . It was launched soon after, in January 2009. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all  transactions  happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use. Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown. On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “ blockchain .” Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the  genesis block , thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time. However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features. Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others. What Makes Bitcoin Unique? Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market. It has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently inspired the development of thousands of competing projects. The entire cryptocurrency market  — now worth more than $2 trillion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world without reliance on trusted intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies. Thanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest  cryptocurrency , with a  market capitalization  that surpassed the $1 trillion mark in 2021, after Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $64,863.10 on April 14, 2021. This is owing in large part to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, and the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC:  wallets , exchanges, payment services, online games and more.

What is wrapped Bitcoin? Will Bitcoin volatility ever reduce? How to use a Bitcoin ATM How Much Bitcoin Is in Circulation? Bitcoin’s total supply is limited by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are created during the process known as  “mining” : as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations. As compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that they successfully add to the blockchain. At the moment of Bitcoin’s launch, the reward was 50 bitcoins per block: this number gets  halved  with every 210,000 new blocks mined — which takes the network roughly four years. As of 2020, the block reward has been halved three times and comprises 6.25 bitcoins. Bitcoin has not been premined, meaning that no coins have been mined and/or distributed between the founders before it became available to the public. However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin. Mining Bitcoins  can be very profitable for miners, depending on the current hash rate and the price of Bitcoin. While the process of mining Bitcoins is complex, we discuss  how long it takes  to mine one Bitcoin on CoinMarketCap  Alexandria  — as we wrote above, mining Bitcoin is best understood as how long it takes to mine one block, as opposed to one Bitcoin. As of mid-September 2021, the Bitcoin mining reward is capped to 6.25 BTC after the  2020 halving , which is roughly $299,200 in Bitcoin price today. How Is the Bitcoin Network Secured? Bitcoin is secured with the  SHA-256 algorithm , which belongs to the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms, which is also used by its fork Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), as well as several other cryptocurrencies. What Is Bitcoin’s Role as a Store of Value? Bitcoin is the first decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency. One of its most important functions is that it is used as a decentralized store of value. In other words, it provides for ownership rights as a physical asset or as a unit of account. However, the latter store-of-value function has been debated. Many crypto enthusiasts and economists believe that high-scale adoption of the top currency will lead us to a new modern financial world where transaction amounts will be denominated in smaller units. The smallest units of Bitcoin, 0.00000001 BTC, are called  Satoshis  (or Sats in short), in a nod to the pseudonymous creator. At Bitcoin price now, 1 Satoshi is equivalent to roughly $0.00048. The top crypto is considered a store of value, like gold, for many — rather than a currency. This idea of the first cryptocurrency as a store of value, instead of a payment method, means that many people buy the crypto and hold onto it long-term (or HODL) rather than spending it on items like you would typically spend a dollar — treating it as digital gold. Crypto Wallets The most popular wallets for cryptocurrency include both hot and cold wallets. Cryptocurrency wallets vary from hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are able to be connected to the web, while cold wallets are used for keeping large amounts of coins outside of the internet. Some of the top crypto cold wallets are Trezor, Ledger and CoolBitX. Some of the top crypto hot wallets include Exodus, Electrum and Mycelium. Still not sure of which wallet to use? Check out CoinMarketCap Alexandria’s guide on the  top cold wallets of 2021  and  top hot wallets of 2021 . How Is Bitcoin’s Technology Upgraded? A  hard fork  is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade. For example, if users A and B are disagreeing on whether an incoming transaction is valid, a hard fork could make the transaction valid to users A and B, but not to user C. A hard fork is a protocol upgrade that is not backward compatible. This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The old blockchain will continue to exist and will continue to accept transactions, although it may be incompatible with other newer Bitcoin clients. A  soft fork  is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules. Some examples of prominent cryptocurrencies that have undergone hard forks are the following:  Bitcoin’s hard fork  that resulted in Bitcoin Cash,  Ethereum’s hard fork  that resulted in Ethereum Classic. Bitcoin Cash has been hard forked since its original forking, with the creation of Bitcoin SV. Read more about the difference between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV  here . What Is the Lightning Network? The Lightning Network is an off-chain, layered payment protocol that operates bidirectional payment channels which allows instantaneous transfer with instant reconciliation. It enables private, high volume and trustless transactions between any two parties. The Lightning Network scales transaction capacity without incurring the costs associated with transactions and interventions on the underlying blockchain. How Much Is Bitcoin? The current valuation of Bitcoin is constantly moving, all day every day. It is a truly global asset. From a start of under one cent per coin, BTC has risen in price by thousands of percent to the numbers you see above. The prices of all cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, meaning that anyone’s understanding of how much Bitcoin is will change by the minute. However, there are times when different countries and exchanges show different prices and understanding how much Bitcoin is will be a function of a person’s location. Where Can You Buy Bitcoin (BTC)? Bitcoin is, in many regards, almost synonymous with cryptocurrency, which means that you can  buy Bitcoin  on virtually every crypto exchange — both for fiat money and other cryptocurrencies. Some of the main markets where BTC trading is available are: Binance Coinbase Pro OKEx Kraken Huobi Global Bitfinex If you are new to crypto, use CoinMarketCap’s own educational portal —  Alexandria  — to learn how to start buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is DFI.MONEY (YFII)? DFI.MONEY, also known as YFII, is a fork of popular decentralized finance ( DeFi ) aggregator platform yearn.finance ( YFI ). Launched in July 2020, it aims to optimize returns for DeFi investors while adhering to changes proposed in an upgrade plan called YIP-8. In addition to protocol changes, DFI.MONEY has also released new products, chief among which, the Vault, it describes as its “killer product.” The native token of DFI.MONEY is YFII, a fixed-supply token which liquidity providers earn in accordance with their network interaction. Who Are the Founders of DFI.MONEY? DFI.MONEY originated as a hard fork of yearn.finance, the aggregator for DeFi returns created by Andre Cronje.  Cronje left the original incarnation of yearn.finance, iEarn, in early 2020, only to return to continue its development, whereupon its popularity grew considerably as DeFi became more mainstream. In July 2020, mining and farming of yearn.finance’s YFI token ended, and a proposal to protect liquidity provision from whales earned 80% support among protocol participants. However, it was not adopted due to not meeting yearn.finance’s requisite 33% quorum requirement. As a result, a group of users opted to hard fork the protocol to create DFI.MONEY, with its own token, YFII. The hard fork implemented the proposal, known as YIP-8, which makes YFII rewards decrease each week, following a pattern popularized by  Bitcoin  (BTC). What Makes DFI.MONEY Unique? DFI.MONEY essentially fulfils the same role in the DeFi marketplace as yearn.finance, subject to different protocol rules for its token and with some new features. Its appeal is thus aimed at users of its predecessor who voted in favor of YIP-8, as well as newcomer DeFi investors who want to maximize returns by providing liquidity. DFI.MONEY’s website states that its protocol is community-owned and does not offer commercial incentives such as developer rewards by default. Users join one or both of two liquidity pools which feature  Curve  (CFI) or  Balancer  (BAL), earning YFII tokens as a reward for providing liquidity.  DFI.MONEY also introduced a new feature, the Vault, which seeks to gain users the highest returns of any token automatically according to user-submitted strategies, without the users themselves manually setting up transactions.  Related Pages : Read more about yearn.finance  here . Read more about Harvest Finance  here . New to crypto? Find the answers to all your questions with  Alexandria , CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource. How Many DFI.MONEY (YFII) Coins Are There in Circulation? YFII is an ERC-20 standard token with a fixed supply of 40,000 YFII. According to the characteristics set out and accepted in YIP-8, no premine, presale or developer-allocated tokens were taken from the total supply. DFI.MONEY states that the only way of earning YFII is by providing liquidity to the protocol. Tokens are distributed according to liquidity provision, with rewards decreasing weekly. Each of the two liquidity pools began with a supply of 20,000 YFII. A schedule confirms that token distribution was completed 10 weeks after it began, at the end of September 2020. How Is the DFI.MONEY Network Secured? DFI.MONEY states that YFII has a guaranteed fixed supply of 40,000 tokens which cannot be manipulated by developers. This was made possible by sending keys allowing minting of new tokens to a so-called “blackhole” address, and access to them is permanently lost. Developers published links to the transactions showing transfer of the keys to the blackhole. Where Can You Buy DFI.MONEY (YFII)? YFII has become a popular trading token since its launch. As of October 2020, it is available on multiple major exchanges, with trading pairs featuring cryptocurrencies,  stablecoins  and other DeFi tokens. Binance ,  OKEx  and  Huobi Global  are among the exchanges with the largest YFII volume. Still a crypto newbie? Read our  easy guide  to buying Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.

The lack of interoperability between blockchains is still one of the factors preventing the technology from entering the mainstream financial world. AION aims to create a platform that will effectively be able to replace the current way banks are running global finance. The OAN has already partnered with numerous big names in the industry like CryptoCurve, Nodesmith and BlockX Labs. Not only that, but AION is a member of the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance.

How Many Aion (AION) Coins Are There in Circulation? There is a total supply of 487,496,874 AION tokens. Currently, all of the total supply has entered the market and is actively being traded. There is no information on whether OAN plans to release more tokens in the future or if the current total supply will also be the maximum supply for AION.  Founders and other team members received about 40% of the total supply of AION tokens. Another 51.5% of AION tokens were directed towards Token Release Schedule Contracts, which will be gradually made available to the public over time. Finally, the remaining 8.5% of tokens were distributed among private investors interested in the seed phase of AION’s launch.  How Is the Aion Network Secured? The OAN blockchain and AION token are secured by a combination of delegated proof-of-stake ( DPoS ) and proof-of-importance (PoI) consensus methods. One important characteristic of the blockchain is that it relies on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance for additional security.  DPoS is a relatively new consensus mechanism, which relies on stakeholders for the validation of new blocks, and thus, the creation of new tokens. Unlike the  proof-of-work  (PoW) consensus, which requires a lot of computing and electrical power for the mining process, PoS consensus mechanisms are more scalable and environmentally friendly. By placing importance on the number of coins staked.  Where Can You Buy Aion (AION)? You can purchase AION tokens on several of the largest exchanges.  Binance  has the largest processed volume of AION/USD transactions at $8,419,408 as of February 2021. Other options for trading AION include  Bitrue ,  Bithumb , and  Bitvavo .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is VeChain (VET)? VeChain (VET) is a blockchain-powered supply chain platform. Begun in 2015 and launched in June 2016, VeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create an ecosystem which solves some of the major problems with supply chain management. The platform uses two in-house tokens, VET and  VTHO , to manage and create value based on its VeChainThor public blockchain. The idea is to boost the efficiency, traceability and transparency of supply chains while reducing costs and placing more control in the hands of individual users. Who Are the Founders of VeChain (VET)? VeChain is the product of creator and co-founder Sunny Lu, an IT executive who was formerly CIO of Louis Vuitton China.  Lu has since become a well-known name within the cryptocurrency industry. He has drawn attention to the ability of blockchain technology to solve transparency in particular, arguing that it can create “trust-free” structures which do not suffer from corruption as part of the supply chain. Fellow co-founder Jay Zhang, who directs VeChain's global corporate structure, governance, and financial management, previously worked for both Deloitte and PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the finance and risk management sphere.  Having launched in June 2016, VeChain is one of the oldest dedicated blockchain supply chain platforms on the market. What Makes VeChain (VET) Unique? VeChain exists to disrupt traditional supply chain models, an industry which before blockchain had remained little changed over the decades. Using transparent technology with no single point of weakness or control allows for greater security, efficiency and ease of tracking products in a given supply chain, while reducing cost through trustless automation. VeChain’s model thus appeals to businesses looking to reduce supply chain friction and give a more transparent impression to clients. VeChain’s official literature notes that its unique proposition lies in its dual-token setup, among other features. In-house token fees combine with charges for various services to generate operating income for the company, while token holders can engage in activities such as staking, thus providing liquidity in return for rewards.

How Many VeChain (VET) Coins Are There In Circulation? VeChain has two in-house tokens: VeChain (VET) and VeThor (VTHO). Described as a unique offering for such a platform, the dual-token system is designed to avoid fee fluctuations and network congestion. VET is the token used for transactions and other activities, while VTHO provides fee payments and thus functions as a “gas token,” similar to how  gas  functions for Ethereum ( ETH ) transactions. VET holders automatically generate a small amount of passive income in VTHO, while 70% of the VTHO used in a VET payment is destroyed.  VTHO is generated based on VET holdings, while VET itself has a maximum fixed supply of 86,712,634,466 tokens.  How Is the VeChain (VET) Network Secured? VeChain (VET) is a  proof-of-stake  token, and VeChain itself explains that relatively low computing power is required to achieve network security and maintain user consensus.  A separate feature,  proof-of-authority , involves authority masternode operators maintaining the protocol in their own interest according to rules laid down by parent organization, the VeChain Foundation. Where Can You Buy VeChain (VET)? VET is a freely-tradable token available on major exchanges, while markets also exist for VTHO. VET had major markets on Binance and Huobi Global among other platforms, with pairs for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is DigiByte (DGB)? DigiByte (DGB) is an open source  blockchain  and asset creation platform. Development began in October 2013 and the  genesis block  of its DGB token was mined in January 2014 as a fork of  Bitcoin  (BTC). A longstanding public blockchain and cryptocurrency, DigiByte uses five different algorithms to improve security, and originally aimed to improve on the Bitcoin blockchain’s security, capacity and transaction speed. DigiByte consists of three layers: a smart contract “App Store,” a public ledger and the core protocol featuring nodes communicating to relay transactions. Who Are the Founders of DigiByte? DigiByte was created by Jared Tate, also known as “DigiMan,” who oversaw its metamorphosis from development to its current setup before announcing that he was temporarily retiring from his position in May 2020. Tate has since returned, and as of September 2020 once again appears closely involved with DigiByte’s growth. Tate’s biography states that he was involved with Bitcoin from 2012 onwards, and authored the first book written by a blockchain founder, “Blockchain 2035: The Digital DNA of Internet 3.0.” DigiByte’s operations depend not only on developers, but also the DigiByte Foundation, a volunteer organization tasked with overseeing preservation of the project. A third group of volunteers, the DigiByte Awareness Team, is responsible for marketing and promotional activities. What Makes DigiByte Unique? DigiByte is a modification of Bitcoin which aims to diversify security, speed and capacity possibilities. Its first incarnation was as an open source blockchain and associated cryptocurrency, DGB. The network has five separate algorithms which help to maintain security and help prevent  ASIC  miners from commandeering too much power. Later, another offering, DigiAssets, appeared, with DGB as its native token. DigiAssets appeals to those developers looking to launch digital assets, decentralized applications ( DApps ) and encode the necessary corresponding smart contracts. All governance structures for DigiByte are run on a voluntary basis, in line with the thesis that the network should be open source and publicly accessible. Transaction fees in DGB are paid to  miners  for validating the blockchain. Related Pages : Find out more about Litecoin (LTC)  here . Find out more about Ethereum (ETH)  here . New to cryptocurrency? Find out everything you need to know with  Alexandria , CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource. How Many DigiByte (DGB) Coins Are There In Circulation? DigiByte (DGB) is a  proof-of-work  (PoW) cryptocurrency, and miners earn tokens for validating blocks via block rewards. In January 2014, 0.5% of the total DGB supply (105 million coins) was premined. 50% of the premine was reserved for development purposes, while the remainder was given away.  DGB has a hard supply cap of 21 billion tokens, with mining forming an emission curve with decreasing issuance — the block reward reduces by 1% each month. DigiByte has stated that it purposely did not try to raise funds or give away tokens through instruments such as an initial coin offering ( ICO ) or similar token sale. How Is the DigiByte Network Secured? DigiByte uses a total of five proof-of-work algorithms to secure the blockchain and reduce the risk of double spending or  51% attacks .  Difficulty adjustments ensure resilience against hostile moves within mining circles, with DigiByte claiming to have the most advanced such difficulty setup among cryptocurrencies. With roughly one block every 15 seconds, DigiByte’s blockchain has managed to prove the longevity of its PoW blockchain since launch, now having a much longer chain of PoW than, for example, Bitcoin. Where Can You Buy DigiByte (DGB)? DGB is a freely-tradable altcoin and is available on multiple exchanges. Trading pairs are available for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies.  Bilaxy,  Binance , Sistemkoin and  OKEx  had the lion’s share of volume for DGB trading pairs as of September 2020. New to crypto? Find out how to buy Bitcoin or any other token  here .

Polkadot is up 4.34% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #8, with a live market cap of $51,039,885,955 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 987,579,315 DOT coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Polkadot , the top exchanges for trading in  Polkadot  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Polkadot (DOT)? Polkadot is an  open-source sharding multichain protocol  that facilitates the cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, not just tokens, thereby making a wide range of blockchains interoperable with each other. This interoperability seeks to establish a fully decentralized and private web, controlled by its users, and simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services. The Polkadot protocol connects public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot relay chain (explained further down). Polkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: providing network governance and operations, and creating parachains (parallel chains) by bonding. Polkadot has four core components: Relay Chain: Polkadot’s “heart,” helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains; Parachains: independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases; Parathread: similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model; Bridges: allows parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum. Who Are the Founders of Polkadot? Polkadot was founded by the Web3 Foundation, a Swiss Foundation founded to facilitate a fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web, as an open-source project. Its founders are Dr. Gavin Wood, Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban. Wood, the Web3 Foundation’s president, is the most well-known of the trio thanks to his industry influence as Ethereum co-founder, Parity Technologies founder and the creator of the smart contract coding language Solidity. Habermeier is a Thiel Fellow and accomplished blockchain and cryptography researcher and developer. Czaban is the Web3 Foundation’s Technology Director. With a wealth of experience across highly specialized fintech industries, he is currently helping to develop a new generation of distributed technology. What Makes Polkadot Unique? Polkadot is a sharded multichain network, meaning it can process many transactions on several chains in parallel (“parachains”). This parallel processing power improves scalability. Custom blockchains are quick and easy to develop through the Substrate framework and can be connected to Polkadot’s network within minutes. The network is also highly flexible and adaptive, allowing the sharing of information and functionality between participants similar to apps on a smartphone. Polkadot can be automatically upgraded without the need for a fork in order to implement new features or remove bugs. The network has a highly sophisticated user-driven governance system that also helps to secure it. Communities can customize their blockchain’s governance on Polkadot based on their needs and evolving conditions. Nominators, validators, collators and fishermen all fulfil various duties to help secure and maintain the network and eradicate bad behavior. Related Pages: Learn more about  Cosmos (ATOM) .

How Many Polkadot (DOT) Tokens Are There in Circulation? Polkadot currently has an allocation of 1 billion DOT tokens, following the  network’s redenomination  from an initial maximum supply of 10 million in August 2020. The redenomination was undertaken purely to avoid the use of small decimals and make calculation easier. While all balances were increased by a factor of one hundred, this did not impact the distribution of DOT or holders’ proportional share. Polkadot’s first initial coin offering (ICO) was held in October 2017. The Polkadot price at ICO was $0.29, with 2.24 million tokens offered. The second ICO was held in July 2020, with a Polkadot price per token of $1.25 and 342,080 DOT tokens sold. How Is the Polkadot Network Secured? Polkadot’s mass interoperability through a set of common validators helps to secure its multiple blockchains and allows them to scale their transactions by spreading their data across many parachains. The network uses the NPoS (nominated proof-of-stake) mechanism to select validators and nominators and maximize chain security. This unique validity scheme enables chains to interact with each other securely under the same rules, yet remain independently governed. Where Can You Buy Polkadot (DOT)? The top exchanges for Polkadot (DOT) trading are currently  Binance ,  Huobi Global ,  Coinbase ,  Bithumb ,  Gate.io  and more.

Neo is up 1.20% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #53, with a live market cap of $3,313,775,585 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 70,538,831 NEO coins   and a max. supply of 100,000,000 NEO coins.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Neo (NEO)? Neo bills itself as a “rapidly growing and developing” ecosystem that has the goal of becoming the foundation for the next generation of the internet — a new economy where digitized payments, identities and assets come together. Initially known as Antshares, this project was believed to be China’s first-ever public blockchain when it was launched in February 2014. The open-source platform subsequently rebranded to Neo three years later. As well as creating a worldwide community of developers who create new infrastructure for the network and lower barriers to entry, the team behind this project operate an EcoBoost initiative that’s designed to encourage people to build decentralized apps and smart contracts on its blockchain. It’s often been likened to the Chinese version of the Ethereum network. Who Are the Founders of Neo? The co-founders of Neo, and its predecessor Antshares, are Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. Both serve as chairmen of the Neo Foundation, which aims to promote the blockchain’s adoption. Da Hongfei has said that, although the internet is a great invention, it has many flaws — and this means that everyday consumers don’t always have control over their own data. The entrepreneur believes blockchain applications will eventually go mainstream. Erik Zhang was the author of the Delegated  Byzantine Fault Tolerance  algorithm, which aims to deter untrustworthy participants from taking part in the blockchain’s operation. This technology went on to be used in the Neo blockchain. He also served as the core developer for this network, and is playing an instrumental role in the development of Neo 3.0, the next iteration of the project’s infrastructure. What Makes Neo Unique? One of the unique selling points of the Neo blockchain concerns its continuous development, which helps ensure that it is futureproof and able to cope with sudden increases in demand. As mentioned earlier, the project has developed Neo 3.0 — enhancing network security and allowing a greater number of transactions per second to be processed. Unlike many other blockchains, this network also has two native tokens: NEO and GAS. While NEO serves as an investment token and allows people to participate in votes concerning improvements to the blockchain, GAS is used to pay fees for the transactions that are being completed on the network. Few other blockchain projects also run a development fund to the extent that Neo does. EcoBoost launched back in 2019, and it was billed as an initiative that provides “full life-cycle support for high-potential projects” — including grants, technical support and promotion on social media.

Find out in our blog How Many Neo (NEO) Coins Are There in Circulation? At the time of writing, there are 70.5 million NEO in circulation — and a total supply of 100 million. NEO tokens aren’t mined, and indeed, all 100 million of them were generated when the blockchain launched. These tokens were distributed on a 50/50 basis — with half going to participants in a token sale, and the other half being split among developers and the NEO Council. At the time, it was confirmed that these funds would be used to invest in other blockchain protocol that the organization supports. Meanwhile, GAS is generated every 20 seconds or so, whenever a new block is created. The number of tokens created gradually reduces every year, and it’s estimated that it’ll take 22 years for the total supply of 100 million to enter circulation. How Is the Neo Network Secured? As we mentioned earlier, Neo uses Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and it’s estimated that the blockchain is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second. According to Neo, the dBFT mechanism has been inspired by the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm. There are a couple of similarities with delegated proof-of-stake, given how both consensus mechanisms allow token holders to vote for the delegates who will process transactions. Through dBFT, blocks are added to a blockchain as long as at least two-thirds of delegates reach consensus — and it’s hoped that this helps prevent bad actors from undermining the smooth running of the network. Where Can You Buy Neo (NEO)? NEO can be purchased on a number of exchanges — most people  buy NEO  on Binance, Poloniex and HitBTC. But it isn’t available universally and isn’t supported by some platforms, such as Coinbase. Many exchanges offer trading pairs that link NEO with Bitcoin.

Bancor is up 1.98% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #104, with a live market cap of $1,059,725,577 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 237,334,649 BNT coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Bancor , the top exchanges for trading in  Bancor  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   FTX ,    and   Huobi Global .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Bancor (BNT)? Bancor consists of a series of smart contracts that manage the on-chain conversion of tokens. The protocol makes it effortless and quick to convert tokens without having to go through an exchange. The protocol's smart contracts manage the liquidity pools that connect various tokens available in the network.  The major token used on the network is the “Bancor Network Token,” BNT. Currently, Bancor and Uniswap are the frontrunners for this new DeFi trend.  Who Are the Founders of Bancor? Bancor was founded by Eyal Hertzog, Yudi Levi, and Galia and Guy Benartzi in 2017. It was named \"Bancor\" to honour John Maynard Keynes, who came up with the word 76 years ago to describe a supranational currency. Eyal Hertzog  is the product architect of the protocol, BNT, and other   products that utilize the network. He is a known voice in the crypto industry and has been a technology entrepreneur for over 20 years. He previously founded MetaCafe, a top video sharing site in Israel with over 50 million users. Guy Benartzi  is the chief executive at Bancor. He also co-founded Mytopia in 2005, a company that develops cross-platform games for users on social networks.  Galia Benartzi  has been a technology entrepreneur for many years, and is a co-founder of the Bancor protocol. At Bancor, she is the business developer. She is also the CEO and founder of Particle Code.  Yudi Levi  is the CTO at Bancor. He has been a technology entrepreneur for over 20 years. He previously co-founded AppCoin, an app that allows communities to create their own currencies. What Makes Bancor Unique? Bancor enables the seamless conversion of tokens used in the network. This removes the need for an exchange or third-party platforms. The protocol also maintains several self-governing pools for tokens supported by the network.  The uniqueness of Bancor is in their goal to create liquidity for altcoins and to remunerate liquidity providers. The protocol monotonously converts various crypto tokens into other tokens, including those running on other blockchains, without the interference of a third party.  BNT, the protocol’s main token, is the default for all smart tokens created on the network. Bancor’s creation of smart tokens is the first of its kind to be built via blockchain technology. The protocol’s main objective for creating smart tokens is to provide a lasting solution to liquidity problems, hence making it different from other market makers.  How Many Bancor (BNT) Coins Are In Circulation? In January, Bancor made a move to provide more liquidity and awareness for its native token. Therefore, it distributed some ETH/BNT valued at $60,000 into various wallets that were holding a required minimum of BNT. In 2017, the protocol raised more than $144M during its initial coin offering. The protocol allows other tokens to be liquidated as well. However, these tokens (also called reserve tokens) must comply with ERC-20 or EOS standards.  Bancor ecosystem supports a two-way token model: liquid tokens and relay tokens. A liquid token  is an automated token with a single reserve that mints and destroys itself. It does this either by sending the reserve token to its smart contract or removing it from the smart contract. In order to use Bancor Network, a liquid token must have its reserve token either in BNT or a derivative of BNT.  On the other hand,  relay tokens  are used in staking to provide liquidity. The token holders will get a percentage of the future earnings of Bancor. Relay tokens indicate the proportion of amount staked to the total value in the pool. How Is The Bancor Network Secured? The protocol’s smart token allows traders to provide liquidity for the pools available on the network. Anyone can contribute liquidity to the pools. When liquidity providers contribute liquidity to a pool, they are eligible to receive rewards for trades that pass through the pool. Liquidity providers will receive pool tokens that represent a percentage of their total stake. How Can You Buy Bancor Network Token (BNT)? As at the time of this writing, Bancor has facilitated over $2 billion trades involving several tokens, as well as cross-chain tokens. The network has made millions through staking, which are distributed to BNT token stakers. Several exchanges that support BNT include  Binance , Coinswitch and ZenGo.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is KardiaChain (KAI)? KardiaChain is a  blockchain  platform that aims to be fully interoperable and \"non-invasive,\" meaning that blockchains can connect to the network without needing to make technical modifications to their own protocols. KardiaChain uses a dual-node structure to facilitate the connection between its own ledger and other blockchains, sharding for scalability and  smart contracts  for developers. The platform relies on a native token, KAI, which is used for  staking , transaction fees, participating in services and deploying smart contracts. KardiaChain was first  announced  in October 2018, and its mainnet  went live  in December 2020. Who Are the Founders of KardiaChain? KardiaChain was founded by two former high-school classmates, Tri Pham and Huy Nguyen, with Pham serving as CEO and Hguyen as chief technology officer. Pham is a long-time entrepreneur, and before KardiaChain, he co-founded AppFluke, a startup focused on bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and consumer products. He has  said  that it was his time with AppFluke that first made him interested in bringing new technology to the masses, and in 2017, he discovered the true potential applications of blockchain. Together with Nguyen, he focused on the Vietnamese market and launched KardiaChain as a solution for enterprise-focused blockchain interoperability. Nguyen was most recently a technical manager at Google, where he  led  the Google Fiber project. Several other Google employees also joined KardiaChain to form its core development team. Nguyen has also served in technical engineering roles for Cisco, Apple and Hitachi. What Makes KardiaChain Unique? KardiaChain claims to be the first-ever fully non-invasive, interoperable blockchain. The primary way it achieves this is through its dual master node technology, which allows the blockchain to have simultaneous access to both its own ledger and those of other platforms. This allows KardiaChain to operate in conjunction with other blockchains without requiring them to alter their respective protocol or technology. According to its  whitepaper , dual nodes can be  operated  by anyone, making them permissionless, and have a  consensus  mechanism to verify data from both chains. KardiaChain's CEO has  stated  that the platform is working to decentralize the existing systems of governments and enterprises, which allows it to reach millions of users without having to educate the public on blockchain technology. It is specifically focused on targeting users who are not native to crypto. The platform has launched several initiatives intended to increase adoption, including \" adoption decentralized applications ,\" which combine aspects of both centralized and  decentralized apps ;  discounts  on mobile top-ups for Viettel customers when paying with KAI; and  KAIstarter , a  decentralized finance  fundraising and revenue sharing platform. KardiaChain has also inked partnerships with other projects and platforms such as  NEM  (XEM),  MANTRA DAO  (OM),  ShareRing  and  Bounce Finance  (BOT).

Stay up to date on the latest developments in interoperability, adoption and more with the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many KardiaChain (KAI) Coins Are There in Circulation? KardiaChain has a total token supply of 5 billion KAI. Of this amount, 816 million KAI (16.32%) was  allocated  for private sales, and 750 million KAI (15%) was  made available  for sale during an  initial exchange offering  via  Gate.io . 1 billion KAI (20%) was reserved for the ecosystem, with 10% available immediately and 10% subject to lock-ups, and 250 million KAI (5%) was reserved for the community, subject to a 3-month lock-up. An additional 500 million KAI (10%) was allocated for block rewards, which will be released over a period of 10 years. The KardiaChain team was allocated 600 million KAI (12%), its advisors were given 150 million KAI (3%), and 934 million KAI (18.68%) was kept for foundation reserves. These tokens were all subject to a 12-month lock-up and 24-month vesting period. KAI was initially issued as an  ERC-20  token on the  Ethereum  blockchain, but was later  swapped  for a token native to the KardiaChain blockchain upon its mainnet launch. How Is the KardiaChain Network Secured? The KardiaChain network is secured with a  Byzantine Fault Tolerance  delegated  proof-of-stake  consensus, meaning that new blocks added to the chain must be approved by a two-thirds majority and stakeholders may delegate the validation of transactions to trusted third parties. According to its white paper, KardiaChain's dual-node approach to interoperability ensures that the security of other blockchains is not affected when they interact with KardiaChain. Blockchain security firm CertiK  completed  an audit of the KardiaChain mainnet in December 2020, shortly before its launch, reporting that \"all the issues identified within the scope of the audit were formally addressed by the team.\" Where Can You Buy KardiaChain (KAI)? KAI can be purchased on several  cryptocurrency  exchanges, including  Bilaxy ,  KuCoin ,  Hoo  and  Gate.io . It can be traded against the South Korean won,  Bitcoin  (BTC),  Ether  (ETH) and the  stablecoin   Tether  (USDT). Are you interested in buying KAI or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin ?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . Perpetual Protocol was launched in late 2019, originally under the name of Strike Protocol. Perpetual Protocol builds on an Uniswap-inspired automated market maker (AMM) design (constant product curve). Perpetual Protocol’s liquidity pool (k) is virtualized and determined algorithmically. Rather than rely on liquidity providers to determine the curve of a given market, Perpetual Protocol can programmatically set and update the parameters of the virtual AMM (x*y=k) and offer a competitive product for any given market at all times. The team claims that PERP is the first virtual AMM (vAMM), which enables markets with no makers while still guaranteeing on-chain liquidity. These maker-less markets lowers the capital demands traditional markets require and pave the way for new and emerging futures.  Perpetual Protocol’s Insurance Fund is guaranteed by the holders of its native token, $PERP. The Insurance Fund is used to cover any unexpected losses from leveraged trading. If the Insurance Fund is depleted, Perpetual Protocol will mint more $PERP to refill the Insurance Fund and cover the losses.  $PERP holders can stake their assets to Perpetual Protocol’s staking pool for a fixed period of time. In return, stakers are rewarded with a percentage of the transaction fees accumulated across the protocol in addition to inflationary staking rewards. As the name suggests, Perpetual Protocol focuses exclusively on perpetual swap contracts. At launch, Perpetual Protocol will support BTC, ETH, and LINK, and can onboard other synthetic assets such as gold, crude oil, or other fiat currencies through governance in the future. Traders can get up to 20X leverage on both long and short positions. Perpetual Protocol is supported by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with a strong presence in Asia. It is not intended for United States residents or citizens. Here are some other articles that you may be interested in: What Is a Crypto Faucet? What Are Crypto Debit Cards? What Is Web 3.0?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is SingularityNET (AGIX)? SingularityNET is a  blockchain-powered  platform that allows anybody to easily \"create, share, and monetize\" AI services, thanks to its globally-accessible AI marketplace. Through the SingularityNET marketplace, users can browse, test and purchase a huge variety of AI services using the platform’s native utility token — AGIX. Moreover, the marketplace represents an outlet AI developers can use to publish and sell their AI tools, and easily track their performance.  The team behind SingularityNET pioneered the development of an AI known as Sophia, which is described as the \"world's most expressive robot\". SingularityNET’s goal is to enable Sophia to be able to fully understand human language, and continue developing “OpenCog” — an AI framework that is hoped to eventually achieve a state known as “advanced general intelligence,” i.e. human-level artificial intelligence (or beyond).  The platform was first announced in 2017 and completed an initial coin offering ( ICO ) in December the same year, raising $36 million in just one minute.  Who Are the Founders of SingularityNET? SingularityNET has an extensive team largely of AI scientists, developers, researchers and engineers.  It was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel (SingularityNET's CEO and chief scientist) in addition to Simone Giacomelli and Dr. David Hanson. Dr. Ben Goertzel is an established figure in the AI and robotics industry and has a long distinguished track record of working with advanced technology companies — including Hanson Robotics and the OpenCog Foundation. He also works as Mozi Health's chief scientist and vice chairman for Humanity+. Simone Giacomelli is an entrepreneur and investor that previously worked for crypto consultancy Cryptodex. He left the SingularityNET project in March 2019 and is now focused on the technology R&D lab Vulpem, which he founded in 2015. Dr. David Hanson is SingularityNET's third co-founder. He has a long and varied history in the robotics industry, working with Disney between 1998 and 2001 before founding several robotics startups — including Human Emulation Robotics, Initiative for Awakening Machines and Hanson Robotics over the last two decades. What Makes SingularityNET Unique? SingularityNET is the first platform that makes it easy for developers to sell their AI tools and libraries and enables buyers to test any AI service provided on the marketplace to see if it meets their needs before making payment.  On top of this, those in need of specific AI services can also tap SingularityNET’s extensive community of AI specialists through the Request for AI portal (RFAI) — which allows customers to easily commission a new AI tool, while developers can earn AGIX tokens by filling these requests.  The utility of the AGIX token has evolved with the development of the SingularityNET ecosystem. In October 2020, SingularityNET launched its SingularityNET Enhancement Proposal (SNEP) feature, enabling AGIX holders to vote on changes to the network’s operations. Whereas in March 2020, a staking feature was added, enabling users to stake their tokens  In a collaboration with Hanson Robotics, SingularityNET recently released a joint venture known as Awakening Health, which develops products that leverage AI for healthcare purposes. Its first product is Grace, a humanoid assistant for the healthcare industry. Related Pages: Check our  Rarible (RARI)  — a decentralized marketplace for non-fungible tokens.

As of February 2021, a total of 861.5 million AGIX tokens representing 86% of the total supply were in circulation. As such, AGIX can be considered largely diluted. Half (50%) of the total AGIX supply was sold during SingularityNET's 2017 ICO. Beyond this 20% was reserved for early developer and partner incentives, 18% for the core team members (now fully vested), 8% for the SingularityNET foundation for the long-term development of the platform, whereas the last 4% was reserved for security bounties. How Is SingularityNET Network Secured? AGIX is an  ERC-20  token.  This means it’s backed by the Ethereum  proof-of-work  (PoW)  consensus  algorithm and battle-tested network of tens of thousands of nodes and miners. To date, the Ethereum network has never been successfully  attacked  and is considered one of the most secure networks currently operating.  The team behind SingularityNET has hinted that SingularityNET may move to another blockchain in the future, and recently  announced  it was exploring the possibility of launching on the delegated proof-of-stake ( dPoS )  Cardano  blockchain.  Where Can You Buy SingularityNET (AGIX)? The AGIX token is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including  Binance , KuCoin, and HitBTC. It's also available on two of the most popular  DEXs  —  Uniswap  and Balancer. Currently, the only available trading pairs for AGIX are AGIX/BTC, AGIX/ETH, and AGIX/WETH.  It is not currently possible to purchase AGIX directly with your credit or debit card from any of these exchange platforms, but you may be able to buy  Bitcoin (BTC)  first, and then exchange this for AGIX.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is BitTorrent (BTT)? BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer ( P2P ) file sharing and torrent platform which has become increasingly decentralized in recent years.  Originally released in July 2001, BitTorrent was purchased by  blockchain  platform  TRON  in July 2018.  Since its acquisition, BitTorrent has added various new tools, with a dedicated native cryptocurrency token, BTT, released in February 2019. BTT was launched on TRON’s own blockchain, using its TRC-10 standard. According to its official literature, BitTorrent is currently the “largest decentralized P2P communications protocol” in the world. Who Are the Founders of BitTorrent? The original BitTorrent is the brainchild of Bram Cohen, a developer and entrepreneur who himself has since become well known in the cryptocurrency arena. Cohen has explained that he designed BitTorrent to usurp the dated entertainment industry, which made obtaining material slow and expensive.  The platform has seen multiple legal battles, with Cohen maintaining that it does not break copyright laws in allowing users to share files such as music and movies among themselves. In 2018, TRON completed its acquisition of BitTorrent, bringing BitTorrent under the control of Justin Sun. Sun is notorious for his plugging of both TRON as a cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology, bidding $4.5 million at a charity auction to have lunch with Warren Buffett (well-known anti-crypto figure) and discuss cryptocurrency with him. TRON is also behind the addition of cryptocurrency to BitTorrent, as the BTT token was released on TRON’s blockchain. The move formed part of TRON’s efforts to add further decentralized features to the platform.  What Makes BitTorrent Unique? BitTorrent’s original goal was to disrupt the legacy entertainment industry and how consumers obtain content.  Expensive and inefficient distribution networks were the main target, with original developer Bram Cohen seeing benefits in allowing internet users to distribute content among themselves directly. In the early 2000s, BitTorrent became the go-to P2P file sharing platform, with TRON stepping in 2018.  Under TRON, BitTorrent has expanded its user appeal to those interested in decentralized solutions and cryptocurrency, as well as to its own user base.  Among the added features are BitTorrent Speed, which uses the BTT token as part of its operations. BitTorrent has also branched out into paid services, offering several “premium” versions of its platform which include VPN capabilities and ad-free browsing.

How Many BitTorrent (BTT) Coins Are There in Circulation? BTT is BitTorrent’s native cryptocurrency, issued on TRON’s blockchain as a TRC-10 standard token.  The total supply, as stated in its whitepaper, is 990,000,000,000 BTT. 6% of that total was available in a public token sale, 2% in a private token sale and 9% in a seed sale. Another 20.1% are reserved for airdrops, which are set to occur at various points until 2025. The BitTorrent team and umbrella organization, the BitTorrent Foundation, were awarded 19% of the supply. The TRON foundation holds 20%, with 19.9% going to the BitTorrent ecosystem itself. A final 4% of tokens are reserved for partnership activities. BTT plays various roles in BitTorrent’s products, including allowing users to pay others for faster downloads with BitTorrent Speed. How Is the BitTorrent Network Secured? BitTorrent says that it employs “the highest level of security measures” in order to secure user funds, but advises that cryptocurrency involves inherent risk. The company recommends that users protect themselves against theft, in the form of malware or similar programs, by using options such as biometric verification. Where Can You Buy BitTorrent (BTT)? BTT is tradable for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and even fiat currencies on major exchanges.  Binance ,  Huobi Global  and  OKEx  are among the offerings.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is NEM (XEM)? NEM (New Economy Movement) is an ecosystem of platforms that use  blockchain  and cryptography to provide solutions for businesses and individuals. XEM is the native cryptocurrency of NEM’s NIS1 public blockchain. NIS1 operates in a similar way to Bitcoin ( BTC ): it has a network of distributed independent nodes that process and record transactions on a public ledger called “blockchain.” These nodes are incentivized to contribute their time and computing resources and remain incorruptible via transaction fee rewards; these rewards are paid out in XEM coins to each node that manages to add a new block of transactions to the end of the blockchain. However, NIS1’s blockchain has a number of unique features that set it apart from Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies. The alpha version of NIS1 — or NEM as it was known at that time — was launched on June 25, 2014, and its mainnet went live on March 31, 2015. Who Are the Founders of NEM? NEM was originally created by three developers known by their pseudonyms on the Bitcointalk.org forum: Jaguar0625, BloodyRookie and gimre. Since its inception in 2014-2015, NEM has grown from a personal project of three programmers to a large ecosystem composed of several platforms. NEM’s overall development and promotion is now managed by NEM Group. NEM Group is a parent company designed to support the growth of the NEM ecosystem leading up to the launch of Symbol (NEM 2.0) and beyond. NEM Group was formed by a team of experienced NEM representatives and enterprise veterans who realized that a simplified structure would benefit the entire ecosystem, while also promoting more community input and engagement. The NEM Group Board of Directors is responsible for setting the strategy and budgets, and ensuring that all subsidiaries are working towards collective objectives. NEM Group comprises three separate entities: NEM Software, focused on the product and business development; NEM Trading, responsible for all finances, including liquidity management, exchange support and token lending; and NEM Ventures, the venture capital and investment arm, focused on strategic partnerships. What Makes NEM Unique? XEM is a decentralized open-source cryptocurrency that has a number of unique features. Perhaps the most important of these is the way the NIS1 blockchain is secured. NIS1 uses its own proof-of-importance (PoI) algorithm — as opposed to the far more widespread  proof-of-work and proof-of-stake  — for the purpose of ensuring that transactions on the network are processed and recorded in a timely and honest manner. Proof-of-importance allows anyone to run a node on the NIS1 network and facilitate transactions via a process called “delegated harvesting.” The system takes into account every node’s amount of already held coins, how often they transact on the network and who they transact with, in order to approximate their “importance score” in NEM’s economy. Based on this score, the nodes then receive a share of the fees from the transactions they have helped to process. NEM claims that the proof-of-importance system ensures that the network can identify and reward those that actually use it the most. In addition to its unique PoI algorithm, NIS1 also supports such features as multisignature account contracts, encrypted messaging, the Eigentrust++ reputation system and the Apostille service for notarizing and checking the authenticity of files on blockchain. Another important market for NIS1 are enterprise-level solutions: through a purpose-built API system, NEM allows developers to integrate its blockchain infrastructure into third-party applications.

How Many NEM (XEM) Coins Are There in Circulation? The total supply of XEM is 8.999 billion coins, all of which were created since the launch of the network — no new XEM can be mined. The network nodes are incentivized to process transactions via the distribution of fees on the transactions that are included in each new block. How Is the NEM Network Secured? To secure its network, NEM uses Ed25519 public-key signature system and the SHA3 hash algorithm. On Jan. 26, 2018, 523 million NEM (XEM) tokens were stolen in a hack of popular Japanese cryptocurrency exchange  Coincheck . This was due to the exchange being short staffed and suffering technical difficulties, resulting in poor security practices. The stolen XEM tokens were stored in a  hot wallet , which is connected to the internet, instead of an offline  cold wallet  which is standard industry practice. All affected Coincheck users were compensated. Find out more about the  largest crypto hacks in history  and how it affected the exchanges. Where Can You Buy NEM (XEM)?

  "content": "To learn more about this project, check out our  deep dive on Avalanche  (AVAX). What Is Avalanche (AVAX)? Avalanche  is a  layer one blockchain  that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. It is one of Ethereum’s rivals, aiming to unseat  Ethereum  as the most popular blockchain for  smart contracts . It aims to do so by having a higher transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second while not compromising scalability. This is made possible by Avalanche’s unique architecture. The Avalanche network consists of three individual blockchains: the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, which is radically different from the approach Bitcoin and Ethereum use, namely having all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases. After its mainnet launch in 2020, Avalanche has worked on developing its own ecosystem of  DApps  and  DeFi . Different Ethereum-based projects such as SushiSwap and TrueUSD have integrated with Avalanche. Furthermore, the platform is constantly working on improving interoperability between its own ecosystem and Ethereum, like through the development of  bridges . Who Are the Founders of Avalanche? Avalanche was launched by Ava Labs, founded by Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer, and Cornell University computer science PhD’s Kevin Sekniqi and Maofan “Ted” Yin. Gün Sirer is a veteran in cryptographic research, having designed a conceptual peer-to-peer virtual currency six years before the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. He was also involved in work on Bitcoin scaling solutions and research on Ethereum before the infamous The DAO hack in 2016. From that research arose the whitepaper that led to the foundation of Ava Labs in 2018. The project closed a seed round in February 2019 that included investors such as Polychain, Andreessen Horowitz and Balaji Srinivasan. Avalanche closed its initial coin offering in 2020 in under 24 hours, raising $42 million in the process. What Makes Avalanche Unique? Avalanche attempts to solve the  blockchain trilemma , which posits that blockchains cannot achieve a sufficient degree of decentralization at scale. A consequence of this are high gas fees, as is often the case on Ethereum. To solve this problem, Avalanche designed three interoperable blockchains. The Exchange Chain (X-Chain) is employed to create and exchange the native AVAX tokens and other assets. Similar to the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum, these tokens follow a set of standardized rules. It uses the Avalanche consensus mechanism. The Contract Chain (C-Chain) hosts smart contracts and decentralized applications. It has its own Avalanche Virtual Machine, similar to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to fork EVM-compatible DApps. It uses the Snowman consensus mechanism. The Platform Chain (P-Chain) coordinates network validators, tracks active subnets and enables the creation of new subnets. Subnets are sets of validators, sort of like a validator cartel. Each subnet can be validating several blockchains, but a blockchain can only be validated by one subnet. It also uses the Snowman consensus mechanism. This division of computing tasks enables higher  throughput  without compromising on decentralization. For instance, private blockchains on the network could require its subnet’s validators to be sufficiently geographically decentralized or comply with certain regulations. Following this modular structure, Avalanche improves its interoperability with other blockchains wishing to integrate with the Avalanche ecosystem. Furthermore, the two different consensus mechanisms are designed with each blockchain’s requirements in mind, further improving their efficiency.

Get the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with  CoinMarketCap Alexandria . How Many Avalanche (AVAX) Coins Are There in Circulation? The total supply of AVAX is 720 million. Its token distribution is as follows: 2.5% - seed sale, with 10% released on mainnet launch and the rest being released every three months. 3.5% - private sale, with 10% released on mainnet launch and the rest being released every three months. 10% - public sale, with 10% released on mainnet launch and 15% released every three months over a period of 18 months. 9.26% - allocated to the foundation, released over ten years. 7% - community endowment, released over twelve months. 0.27% - testnet incentive program, released over one year. 5% - strategic partners, released over four years. 2.5% - airdrops, released over four years. 10% - team, released over four years. 50% staking rewards Staking AVAX currently provides an annual reward of 11.57%, with the minimum time for staking being two weeks with a minimum of 2,000 AVAX. How Is the Avalanche Network Secured? AVAX is traded on the Exchange Chain, which follows its own Avalanche consensus mechanism. Unlike proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, the Avalanche consensus mechanism does not have one leader processing transactions that get validated by others. Instead, all nodes process and validate transactions by employing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) protocol. That way, transactions are processed simultaneously, and validators' random polling ensures that transactions are correct with statistical certainty. There are no blocks in this consensus mechanism, allowing immediate finalization and significantly improving the blockchain’s speed. Where Can You Buy Avalanche (AVAX)? AVAX price pairs for trading are available on top exchanges such as:  Binance ,  Coinbase ,  Huobi Global ,  Bitfinex ,  Gate.io ,  Kucoin  and more.

Decred is up 0.05% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #83, with a live market cap of $1,535,720,001 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 13,461,749 DCR coins   and a max. supply of 21,000,000 DCR coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Decred , the top exchanges for trading in  Decred  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   Huobi Global ,    and   KuCoin .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Decred (DCR)? Decred (DCR) is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency launched in February 2016. The Decred token and protocol were created to facilitate open governance, community interaction, and sustainable funding policies.  According to the  official whitepaper , Decred was created in such a way that the community approves all transactions and changes made regarding the protocol. Hence, there is no way for big Decred holders to manipulate the operation of the protocol. Decred was heavily influenced by  Bitcoin  and utilized many of the underlying principles of the original cryptocurrency. Who Are the Founders of Decred? The main driving force behind the creation of Decred is an enterprise called Company 0. Its mission is to use the capabilities of  blockchain  technology to create better personal data protection and to bring organizational liberty to projects.  Jake Yocom-Piatt  is the founder and CEO of Company 0. Currently, he is serving as a project lead for the Decred project. His involvement with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology spans over more than ten years. Code written by Jake Yocom-Piatt has been used in the composition of several Bitcoin-related projects, including the creation of  Lightning Network  Daemon. Marco Peereboom  is the chief technical officer of Company 0. He is the direct supervisor of several teams on the Decred project, including development, security, and infrastructure. Mr. Peereboom’s career includes positions in companies like Dell, where he was a Senior Architect. He has been at Company 0 for more than five years, and his involvement with the Decred project is essential for the successful launch of the cryptocurrency.  What Makes Decred Unique? Decred is an innovative project because it bets on blockchain technology’s decentralized nature to prevent monopoly over voting status in the project itself. One of the main goals of the Decred protocol is to ensure that all DCR holders have the same amount of decision-making power and that large institutions cannot swing the votes in their favor.  By introducing ticket-holder voting, Decred ensures that people who have enough DCR will have the opportunity to participate in votes regarding the company/token’s future and operations. Decred also created a dedicated voting platform called Politeia, which allows users to participate in votes, submit proposals and start discussions. Not only that, but to ensure those voting rights, Decred is employing a hybrid consensus mechanism, which combines both the proof-of-work ( PoW ) and proof-of-stake model ( PoS ).

How Many Decred (DCR) Coins Are There in Circulation? Decred plans to issue a total of 21,000,000 tokens. Currently, about 60% of these tokens have entered circulation.  Of the 21 million tokens, 8% were mined before the launch of the protocol. Half of these pre-mined coins went towards an initial airdrop, while the other half was distributed to cover costs acquired by Company 0 during the development of the protocol.  The initial airdrop was designed to reward interested parties by giving them free Decred (DCR) tokens. Tokens were distributed among participants who had registered for the airdrop event beforehand. How Is the Decred Network Secured? Decred uses a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus mechanism, which combines features of the two most popular consensus models. The cryptocurrency uses proof-of-work ( PoW ) to mine new blocks on the blockchain; however, miners receive only 60% of the reward after a successful mining operation. The proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus is used in the voting organization, and it allows users to participate in the ticket-holder voting system. Voters employing the PoS consensus receive 30% of the block reward. The remaining 10% of block rewards are stored in the  Decred Treasury . Decred hosts frequent Politeia discussions and votes on how the funds from the Decred Treasury should be spent.  Where Can You Buy Decred (DCR)? The largest marketplace for Decred (DCR) is  Binance , with a DCR/BTC trade volume of USD 2,493,254. Binance is also the most popular cryptocurrency exchange for DCR/USDT transactions. Other good options for trading Decred include  Huobi Global ,  YoBit ,  BitAsset  and  OKEx . It is important to note that trading cryptocurrency involves risks, like any other investment.

Akropolis is up 2.10% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #385, with a live market cap of $140,095,503 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 3,364,292,849 AKRO coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Akropolis , the top exchanges for trading in  Akropolis  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   CoinTiger ,   FTX ,    and   Huobi Global .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Akropolis (AKRO)? Akropolis is a company that operates an Ethereum-based  decentralized finance  protocol that seeks to provide an autonomous financial ecosystem for saving and growing wealth, including through borrowing and lending. To do so, it offers a series of products including AkropolisOS, a framework for developing for-profit  decentralized autonomous organizations , Sparta, a platform for uncollateralized lending, and Delphi, a  yield farming  aggregator and tool for dollar-cost averaging. The project uses an  ERC-20 token , AKRO, for protocol governance across its suite of products. Akropoli was first  announced  in March 2018,  launching  on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2020. Who Are the Founders of Akropolis? Akropoli was founded in 2017 by Ana Andrianova, with Kate Kurbanova joining later as a co-founder. Prior to starting Akropolis and serving as its CEO, Andrianova co-founded and was managing director of Apiro Capital, a data- and technology-driven investment management firm, in addition to founding private equity advisory firm Sirin Capital. She has additional investment experience from serving as a fund manager for the Lehman Brothers and an emerging markets hedge fund analyst for Emergent Asset Management, where she was responsible for private equity fund strategy. In addition, Kurbanova has served as an advisor for The Bee Token, the Web3 Foundation, Tenzorum and OpenMaker. Kurbanova first began with Akropolis in January 2018 as an advisor and was officially  brought on  as a full-time employee in June 2018, recognized for her contribution to the project by being named its co-founder. Prior to Akropolis, Kurbanova was head of analytics at crypto-asset intelligence company Cindicator, where she developed research tools and methodologies as well as co-authored the company's  CND  token model and  white paper . She has also served as a community and product advisor for  Svandis . What Makes Akropolis Unique? Akropolis was conceived as a distributed savings and pensions fund — a solution to what it described in its initial announcement as \"\"a looming pension deficit apocalypse\"\" resulting from the inevitable collapse of state pensions systems. But in August 2020, the company  stated  that it had shifted its focus to building the underlying framework for such a system by creating AkropolisOS to allow for the rapid launch of for-profit capital pools. AkropolisOS is a Solidity-based, modular framework for the creation and management of distributed capital pools and serves as the base for the company's Sparta and Delphi platforms, with the former providing access to uncollateralized loans. Akropolis has  claimed  that unlike other DeFi protocols, its products reduce the risk associated with these loans by providing community incentives in the form of AKRO to those who provide accurate risk assessments. The company provided some insight into its business model in December 2018,  reporting  that it would focus on building a pipeline of institutional partners and clients, developing technology and academic partnerships, and building out the Akropolis ecosystem. It also holds a significant number of AKRO to be used for internal operations such as marketing and partnership building.

Read an  in-depth guide  on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource. Stay up to date on the latest DeFi news with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many Akropolis (AKRO) Coins Are There in Circulation? Akropolis has a fixed maximum supply of 4 billion AKRO tokens. The company  carried out  two initial private token presales between January 2018 and June 2018. The first round was for investors, advisors and strategic partners, while the second was for active community members. The two sales combined represent 22.5% of the total token supply, and the AKRO sold was locked up for two months following its public sale, vesting monthly for another 12 months. 460 million AKRO — 11.5% of the total supply — was  released  to form the initial circulating supply once the token was  listed  publicly on  cryptocurrency  exchange  Huobi Global  in July 2019, with 8% going to the exchange and 3.5% going to the company. All additional AKRO was subject to lock-up periods following its public listing on the exchange. 9.5% was reserved for team members and advisors, with a one-year lock-up and vesting monthly for 12 months — later  extended  to January 2021; 14% for marketing and community initiatives, with a two-month lock up and vesting 2%, 1.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 4% and 3% of the total supply each month, respectively; and an additional 42.5% for the company, with 40.5% having a one-year lock-up and vesting monthly over two years, and 0.5%, 0.5% and 1% of the total token supply being unlocked after 90, 120 and 180 days, respectively. Updates to Akropolis' vesting schedules are made publicly available on an  online spreadsheet . How Is the Akropolis Network Secured? The Akropolis suite of products utilizes a governance token, AKRO, to help secure its protocol. As an ERC-20 token, AKRO transactions rely on the Ethereum blockchain's  proof-of-work   consensus  algorithm to validate any on-chain records. With a PoW consensus, miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the  blockchain , and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted. In August 2019, the  smart contracts  for AKRO were  audited  by blockchain security firm CertiK. The company found that the smart contracts — after Akropolis implemented some suggested changes — were \"\"structurally sound and not vulnerable to any classically known anti-patterns or security issues.\"\" In August 2020, Akropolis  reported  that there had been several attempted, but unsuccessful, hacks of its smart contracts. As a result, it moved all unlocked ARKO still in smart contracts to custodial wallets with higher-grade, institutional security. Later that month, it  announced  a bug bounty program, with rewards paid in AKRO or  stablecoins  to those who report a previously undiscovered security flaw. Where Can You Buy Akropolis (AKRO)? AKRO was first listed on  Huobi Global , but it is now available for purchase on a number of major exchanges, including  Binance ,  MXC.COM ,  KuCoin  and  Uniswap (V2) . AKRO can be traded against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Ether  (ETH) and stablecoins such as  Tether  (USDT) and  USD Coin  (USDC) Are you interested in buying AKRO or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin ?

IOTA is up 0.22% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #49, with a live market cap of $3,870,201,614 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 2,779,530,283 MIOTA coins   and a max. supply of 2,779,530,283 MIOTA coins. If you would like to know where to buy  IOTA , the top exchanges for trading in  IOTA  are currently  Binance ,   OKEx ,   FTX ,   Huobi Global ,    and   Upbit .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is IOTA (MIOTA)? IOTA is a distributed ledger with one big difference: it isn’t actually a blockchain. Instead, its proprietary technology is known as Tangle, a system of nodes that confirm transactions. The foundation behind this platform says this offers far greater speeds than conventional blockchains — and an ideal footprint for the ever-expanding Internet of Things ecosystem. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  IOTA . Because there’s no blockchain, there are no miners, and because there are no miners, there are no fees. Many established networks see costs balloon when congestion intensifies, but IOTA aims to provide limitless throughput at minimal expense. In time, IOTA’s goal is to become the de facto platform for executing transactions between IoT devices. Given how estimates suggest there could be 20.4 billion such devices out there by 2024, this could end up being big business. The team behind IOTA believe that the potential use cases don’t end here. They believe their distributed ledger could deliver digital identities to all, result in car insurance policies that are based on actual usage, pave the way for cutting-edge smart cities, deliver seamless global trade and prove the authenticity of products. Originally known as Jinn, a crowdsale for the project was held in September 2014, and the network officially launched in 2016. Who Are the Founders of IOTA? IOTA has  four co-founders , and their names are Sergey Ivancheglo, Serguei Popov, David Sønstebø and Dominik Schiener. According to the IOTA Foundation, the initiative has rapidly grown since then — and team members are now based across more than 25 countries. Sonstebo and Schiener are collectively co-chairmen of the board of directors, while Popov is a board member and the foundation’s director of research. Ivancheglo resigned from the Berlin-based project back in June 2019 but continues as an unofficial advisor. At the time, he said in a statement: “I no longer believe that the IOTA Foundation is the best setting for me to realize what we set out to create back in 2014 and 2015. I have always done my best work in a less rigid environment. I am looking forward to continuing the work on both hardware and software development of IOTA independently.” What Makes IOTA Unique? Well, as we alluded to a little earlier, the fact that it’s effectively a blockchainless blockchain is rather unusual to say the least. Tangle’s more technical name is the Directed Acyclic Graph — and as Sønstebø explained in a blog post back in 2015, this technology aims to retain blockchain’s ability to execute secure transactions. The only difference is that it does away with the notion of blocks. He also wrote: “IOTA should not be considered an alternative coin (altcoin) to existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, rather it is an extension of the growing blockchain ecosystem. It’s meant to work in synergy with these other platforms to form cohesion and symbiotic relationships. IOTA is designed to provide one solution that no other crypto does: efficient, secure, lightweight, real-time micro-transactions without fees.” New transactions are validated by approving two previous transactions from another node — and this is a novel approach because it means that the network’s size and speed will be directly related to how many people are using the platform. And whereas some cryptocurrencies are run as a business, the IOTA Foundation says it is firmly not for profit — adding that it has the sole goal of making the network as prosperous as possible. Finally, IOTA has distinguished itself from many other crypto rivals by establishing high-profile partnerships with the carmaker Volkswagen, and helping the city of Taipei to pursue smart projects. Read our deep dives into the latest crypto technology The latest data on crypto’s market cap and trading volumes Today’s top stories in the crypto and blockchain industry CoinMarketCap Blog: Analysis, opinion, news and updates How Many IOTA (MIOTA) Coins Are There In Circulation? MIOTA has a maximum supply of 2,779,530,283 tokens — and all of them are in circulation. When the crowdsale was held, this digital asset was billed as a utility token that could be used for payment across its network, rather than a profit-sharing coin. An incredibly precise 999,999,999 were sold during the 2015 crowdsale, and this generated revenue of 1,337 BTC for the foundation. Given that Bitcoin was only worth about $325 at the time, this could have resulted in a substantial windfall for the team in later years. It is worth noting that the supply of MIOTA did increase in later years, with the team arguing that a greater level of supply would make the token suitable for the “tiny nano transactions” that we’ll likely see through IoT devices. The IOTA Foundation launched in October 2017, and at the time, it owned approximately 5% of the tokens that are in circulation, and these were donated by the community. It said “the majority of these funds will go towards building an army of developers and researchers.” How Is the IOTA Network Secured? Given how the IOTA network isn’t a blockchain, you may not think that it would have much need for a consensus mechanism. However, to help keep the network secure, a relatively straightforward Proof-of-Work puzzle is included in the process of validating a transaction. There have been security concerns surrounding IOTA. In the past, researchers have claimed they have found vulnerabilities in the project’s code. Where Can You Buy IOTA (MIOTA)? MIOTA is available on multiple exchanges — many people choose to  buy MIOTA  on Binance, Bitfinex, and OKEx. According to the project, a range of trading pairs are available, linking the token with Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and fiat currencies including the Japanese yen, euro, pound, and dollar.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . To learn more about this project, check out our  deep dive into Celo . What Is Celo (CELO)? Celo is a  blockchain  ecosystem focused on increasing  cryptocurrency  adoption among smartphone users. By using phone numbers as public keys, Celo hopes to introduce the world’s billions of smartphone owners, including those without banking access, to transacting in cryptocurrency. The network also allows for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications ( DApps ) as part of decentralized finance ( DeFi ). Its mainnet was launched in April 2020. The platform has two native tokens. CELO is a  proof-of-stake  (PoS) token used for transaction fees, governance participation and related activities. In future, the platform aims to host various stablecoins, with one, the Celo Dollar (CUSD), already in use. Who Are the Founders of Celo? Celo was originally founded by a team comprised of people from MIT, Stanford, Google, Square, Circle, Visa, GoDaddy, World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Cambridge University, U.S. Department of Justice, Bank Of America, Capital One, Twitter, Give Directly, and the Gates Foundation Separate entities are aimed at Celo’s promotion and preservation. The dedicated Celo Foundation is a non-profit which launched along with the mainnet, while the Celo Alliance for Prosperity is what the company describes as an “ecosystem of mission-aligned organizations.” What Makes Celo Unique? Celo’s main unique selling point lies in its focus on smartphone users. The company argues that the number of smartphone owners is increasing exponentially, but the number of people using cryptocurrency is rising at a much slower pace. Cryptocurrency is further highly suited to regions in which a large section of the population does not have access to the banking sector, but still has a smartphone. Bridging the gap between the two technologies is what Celo aims to do, along with harnessing the benefits of DeFi by supporting the creation of DApps and smart contracts. Optimized for mobile, the Celo blockchain automatically calculates transaction fees, and also allows users to pay the  gas fees  which power transactions in any currency.

CELO has a capped supply of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens, of which 600 million were available when the mainnet launched in April 2020. The last 40% of the supply will be released gradually via fees and rewards, and various vesting schedules are in place depending on how initial investors received their tokens. In addition, up to 120 million CELO will go towards a reserve designed to maintain the validity and price stability of CUSD. As a stablecoin, CUSD is envisioned as a convenient payment method for Celo users who will not have to worry about their holdings fluctuating in value. How Is the Celo Network Secured? Celo uses proof-of-stake to maintain security, and has a complex election process to determine validators of its blockchain. Holders of CELO are able to use their holdings as a means of participating in elections by voting for groups of validators. Where Can You Buy Celo (CELO)? CELO is a freely tradable cryptocurrency on the  ERC-20  token standard, available at various major exchanges. These include  Coinbase Pro  and  Bittrex , with cryptocurrency, stablecoin and fiat pairs in use. New to cryptocurrency? Check out our  easy guide  to buying  Bitcoin  (BTC) or any other token.

Siacoin is down 0.67% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #106, with a live market cap of $1,032,362,884 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 49,194,712,992 SC coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Siacoin , the top exchanges for trading in  Siacoin  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   FTX ,    and   Huobi Global .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Siacoin (SC)? Siacoin (SC) is the native utility token of Sia, a  blockchain -based distributed, decentralized cloud  storage  platform. Sia acts as a secure, trustless marketplace for cloud storage in which users can lease access to their unused storage space. Agreements and transactions are enforced with  smart contracts , and Siacoin is the medium of exchange for paying for storage on the network. The main  goal  of the project is to become the \"backbone storage layer of the internet.\" Sia was originally  announced  in May 2014 before being revised and  re-announced  a year later in May 2015. It officially  launched  in June 2015. Who Are the Founders of Siacoin? Sia was first  conceived  in mid-2013 by David Vorick while studying computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He discussed the idea over email with Luke Champine, a college friend, who joined the project's development shortly after Vorick presented the concept at a HackMIT hackathon in September 2013. The project was officially named Sia in early 2014, a reference to the Egyptian god of perception. Vorick and Champine were introduced through their college's entrepreneurial center to Jim Pallotta, a billionaire investor and founder of Raptor Group, who invested in the project. Shortly before graduating from college, the two  incorporated  the company Nebulous Inc. — which has since been  rebranded  to Skynet — to formally handle the development of Sia. What Makes Siacoin Unique? According to its  whitepaper , the long-term  goal  of Sia is to compete with existing storage solutions. It  sees  itself as being in direct competition with major cloud storage providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Because of its decentralized nature, Sia is able to  offer  competitive storage rates. Files  stored  on the Sia network are divided into 30 encrypted segments, with each segment uploaded to a unique host for redundancy. The agreements between uploaders and hosts are recorded on Sia's blockchain and enforced using smart contracts. Siacoin acts as the method of payment on the network, with renters paying hosts using SC, and hosts locking SC in smart contracts as collateral. Skynet, the company behind Sia and Siacoin, has announced several products built on top of the Sia network, including  SiaStream  — a cloud-based media streaming application — and the  Skynet  network — its flagship content delivery and file sharing network. The company has received several rounds of funding and grants, including from  Bain Capital Ventures ,  Paradigm  and  INBlockchain . In addition, each storage-related transaction on the Sia network is subject to a 3.9% fee, which is  distributed  to holders of the company's second  cryptocurrency , Siafund — with Skynet holding approximately 85% of all Siafund.

Stay up to date on the latest innovations in blockchain and decentralized storage with the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Siacoin (SC) Coins Are There in Circulation? Siacoin has no maximum supply. Because it is a utility token designed to be used to power transactions via smart contracts, the project has  stated  that there must be a limitless supply in order to match the effectively limitless amount of data that can be created and stored. New Siacoin is introduced as mining rewards through the Sia blockchain's  proof-of-work  mining algorithm. The mining reward started at 300,000 SC and decreased at a rate of 1 SC with each block mined until it  reached  30,000 SC in July 2020. The block reward will now forever remain 30,000 SC. Siacoin is removed from the ecosystem when hosts lose tokens or their collateral is left unrefunded due to bad actions. In the future, the development team  intends  to introduce a proof-of-burn mechanism by which hosts will be required to burn a small percentage of their revenue to prove that they are real and have good intentions. The Sia development team  mined  approximately 100 blocks (around 30 million SC) before publicly releasing the mining algorithm. The platform's team and investors reportedly hold less than 0.1% of the total Siacoin supply. How Is the Siacoin Network Secured? The Sia blockchain is secured using a proof-of-work  consensus  algorithm, meaning that miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority must confirm a record for it to be posted. Sia co-founder Vorick  argued  in June 2017 that proof-of-work is the best way to secure the network because it tethers a malicious actor's ability to attack the network to massive energy requirements and hardware expenses. According to Sia's development team, the fact that hosts have to put up collateral in order to participate in the network's operations  decreases  any incentive for bad actors. In addition, it has  pointed to  the fact that it splits uploaded data into 30 segments, which are then distributed across the globe, as reassurance that its network cannot be taken down except in the event of a massive natural disaster or geopolitical event. And as long as 10 out of 30 hosts survive an attack on its network, files can still be retrieved. Where Can You Buy Siacoin (SC)? Siacoin can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as  Binance ,  OKEx ,  Huobi Global  and  Upbit , among others. It can be traded on spot markets against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the South Korean won, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Ether  (ETH), and the  stablecoin   Tether  (USDT).

Binance aims to bring cryptocurrency exchanges to the forefront of financial activity globally. The idea behind Binance’s name is to show this new paradigm in global finance — Binary Finance, or Binance. Aside from being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has launched a whole ecosystem of functionalities for its users. The Binance network includes the Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain, Binance Academy, Trust Wallet and Research projects, which all employ the powers of  blockchain  technology to bring new-age finance to the world. Binance Coin is an integral part of the successful functioning of many of the Binance sub-projects. Who Are the Founders of Binance Coin? Changpeng Zhao  is the founder and CEO of Binance. In 2001, Zhao joined Bloomberg as head of tradebook futures development. He spent four years with the company and later joined Fusion Systems as a partner. Since 2013, Changpeng Zhao has been actively involved with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. He became head of development at Blockchain, and in 2015 he founded BijieTech. In 2017, Zhao officially launched Binance, and he has been the CEO of the company ever since. He Yi  is a co-founder and chief marketing officer at Binance. She started her career as a TV anchor and presenter on China Travel TV in 2012. Later, in 2014, Yi co-founded OKCoin, which was the largest fiat-to-crypto exchange in China at the time. In 2017, she joined forces with Changpeng Zhao, and together they created the largest crypto exchange globally — Binance. What Makes Binance Coin Unique? Binance is a unique ecosystem of decentralized, blockchain-based networks. The company has grown to be the leading crypto exchange in a number of countries, and their side organizations are attracting significant interest as well. One of the biggest competitive advantages Binance has is its drive for development. While the company started only as a crypto exchange back in 2017, today, Binance has spread its services among numerous different spheres. According to the company website, its mission is to become the infrastructure services provider for the entire blockchain ecosystem.  Since launching the Binance Coin, the exchange has also benefited from increased investor interest in the token. BNB went through a significant price increase at the beginning of 2021, which has put it on the map of enterprise investors. Related Pages: Read more about  Elrond .

How Many Binance Coin (BNB) Coins Are There in Circulation? There is an initial maximum supply of 200,000,000 BNB coins, of which 168,137,036 are currently in circulation as of September 2021. Binance conducts quarterly burning of the Binance Coin supply, with the goal of reducing the total supply by half — or 100,000,000 BNB. On July 18, 2021, it conducted its 16th quarterly burning, which was worth $390 million in Binance Coin price at the time of burning. However, that was not the most expensive burn — on April 16, 2021, the exchange burned nearly $600 million worth, in Binance Coin price at the time of burning. According to the Binance  whitepaper , exactly half of the maximum supply of BNB tokens was allocated towards the initial coin offering (ICO) and public sale of the token. The ICO was held in July 2017 shortly after the exchange launched, and saw Binance raise $15 million in funding, with Binance Coin price at $0.10 during the ICO. Taking Binance Coin price today, that represents an almost 4200X  return on investment  (ROI). Another 40% of the total supply, or around 80,000,000 BNB coins, was distributed among the founding members and team. Finally, the remaining 10% of the maximum supply was split among angel investors. How Is the Binance Coin Network Secured? Initially, the Binance coin started as a traditional  ERC-20  token on the  Ethereum  blockchain. Later on, the company introduced its own blockchain, and the coins started being issued from the Binance blockchain, secured by the Tendermint byzantine-fault-tolerant ( BFT ) consensus mechanism. While ERC-20 tokens rely on the proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus, which allows them to be extremely scalable, and allows for the creation of smart contracts. Unlike PoS, the Binance blockchain does not support smart contract functionalities. In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by the proof-of-work ( PoW ) consensus, which is far more limited and consumes large amounts of electrical and computing power. Where Can You Buy Binance Coin (BNB)? As the dedicated utility token of the Binance exchange, the most straightforward way to acquire BNB coins would be to purchase them through Binance. The original exchange supports the largest variety of trading pairs with BNB, and it also has the best trading rates for the coin. Since the launch of Play2Earn games, interest in the  BNB to PHP price  has increased substantially. If you are looking for alternative exchanges where you can purchase BNB,  FTX  is a good choice. Keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrency can be risky, just like investing in any other type of asset.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is PancakeSwap (CAKE)? PancakeSwap is an automated market maker ( AMM ) — a decentralized finance ( DeFi ) application that allows users to exchange tokens, providing liquidity via farming and earning fees in return. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Pancakeswap . It launched in September 2020 and is a decentralized exchange for swapping BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain. PancakeSwap uses an automated market maker model where users trade against a liquidity pool. These pools are filled by users who deposit their funds into the pool and receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return. These tokens can later be used to reclaim their share of the pool, as well as a portion of the trading fees. These LP tokens are known as FLIP. PancakeSwap also allows users to farm additional tokens such as CAKE and SYRUP. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens and get rewarded with CAKE.  PancakeSwap allows users to trade BEP20 tokens, provide liquidity to the exchange and earn fees, stake LP tokens to earn CAKE, stake CAKE to earn more CAKE and stake CAKE to earn tokens of other projects.  Who Are the Founders of PancakeSwap? PancakeSwap is a Binance Smart Chain-based decentralized exchange ( DEX ) that was launched by anonymous developers with an apparent passion for pancakes. What Makes PancakeSwap Unique? PancakeSwap uses an automated market maker model, meaning that there are no order books and liquidity pools are used instead. A user can earn income by becoming a liquidity provide; by adding their tokens to the liquidity pool they can farm LP tokens and stake their CAKE to earn rewards. They can also try their luck with the lotteries and non-fungible tokens.  The PancakeSwap token CAKE is a BEP20 token that originally launched on Binance Smart Chain. The main function of CAKE is to incentivize the liquidity provision to the PancakeSwap platform. Users can stake their tokens to earn rewards, which is done by depositing Liquidity Provider tokens and locking them up. This is known as farming and is rewarded by the system with CAKE tokens. The tokens can be un-staked with zero holding time. CAKE gives users the opportunity to invest and increase returns in the future but comes with risks. CAKE can be used to enter a lottery on PancakeSwap. Each lottery session takes 6 hours. A single ticket costs 10 CAKE and comes with a random combination of four numbers between 1 and 14, for example, 8-6-4-13. To win the jackpot, which equals 50% of the entire lottery pool, the numbers in your ticket need to match all four of the numbers in the winning ticket. Users can also win non-fungible tokens that can be traded for CAKE or kept in a wallet. Related Pages: Learn about  Waves . Learn about  Vertcoin . Learn about Dego Finance on  CMC Alexandria .

Its main selling point is its high scalability,  stating  that it is the first blockchain network in which state, network and transaction sharding have all been implemented. According to its economics paper, it  seeks to  build up its ecosystem and establish EGLD as a store-of-value asset. To achieve this goal, the network runs on 2,169 validator nodes split into four shards: three execution shards, capable of 5,400 transactions per second each, and one coordination shard, the \"Metachain.\" Elrond's adaptive state sharding architecture completely shards state, transactions and network. It can scale by adding an additional shard when the throughput demand is unmet. It was tested to run 263,000 TPS in a public environment with 1,500 nodes from 29 countries grouped in 50 shards. In order to increase adoption, the project also supports developers building on the platform, allowing them to earn 30% of the smart contract fees as royalties. The company maintains a supply of EGLD tokens to stake on the network during its first year, with validator nodes receiving a 36% annual percentage rate.

Stay up to date on the latest innovations in blockchain technology with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many Elrond (EGLD) Coins Are There in Circulation? The Elrond economic model has a limited supply that starts at 20,000,000 EGLD, with new tokens minted to reward network validators. The maximum supply can never exceed 31,415,926 EGLD, but this number will decrease as more transactions are processed. Elrond's native token was first made available for purchase through a private sale, in which 19% of its initial supply was  sold , with 7.5% made available immediately upon token generation and another 15.41% released every three months. Elrond also held an  initial exchange offering  on Binance, in which 25% was  sold  and made available immediately.  Of the remaining 56%, 7% was reserved for ecosystem rewards, with 50% released immediately and 50% after six months; 8.5% for marketing, grants and an accelerator pool for DApp developers, with 81.17% released immediately and 9.41% every six months; 2% for a community fund, with 33.3% released immediately, 33.3% after six months and 33.3% after 12 months; 2.5% for advisors, released after one year; 19% for Elrond's founders and core team members, with 10% released after six months, 10% after 12 months, 15% after 18, 24, 30 and 36, and 20% after 42 months; and 17% for the company for ecosystem support, with 33.3% that can only be used for staking during the first year released immediately and 66.6% released in three equal installments over three years, starting after one year. Elrond's tokens were first issued on Binance Chain under the name ERD with a total supply of 20 billion. 500 million were  burned  in November 2019 and minted on the  Ethereum  blockchain as  ERC-20  tokens, and the company  launched  a token swap event in September 2020 for token holders to swap their ERC-20 and BEP-2 tokens for mainnet EGLD tokens. During the process, the total token supply was reduced from 20 billion to 20 million by setting the swap ratio at 1,000 ERD for 1 EGLD. How Is the Elrond Network Secured? Elrond  uses  what it calls a secure  proof-of-stake   consensus  algorithm in which nodes must stake their EGLD tokens to participate in the validation process, and each validator is assigned a rating score based on past activity, which also influences whether or not they are selected. If a validator's rating becomes too low, it will not be selected and must pay fines. Validators can also be removed from the network and have their stakes slashed if they continuously act in a manner that is against the integrity of the network. Validators are randomly selected in a way that can be neither predicted nor modified based on the previous round of validations. In addition, validators are periodically shuffled between shards as a way to prevent collusion. Nodes communicate among one another using modified Boneh-Lynn-Shacham, or BLS, multi-signatures for strong cryptographic protection. Where Can You Buy Elrond (EGLD)? EGLD can be purchased on  cryptocurrency  exchanges such as  Binance ,  OKEx ,  Bitfinex  and  BitMax . It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and Indonesian rupiah, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Binance Coin  (BNB), and  stablecoins  such as  Tether  (USDT) and  Binance USD  (BUSD). It can be bought and sold on both spot and derivatives markets. Are you interested in buying EGLD or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin ?

KyberDAO  recently approved KIP-6 to migrate and upgrade $KNC to make the token more dynamic with the ability to support efficient upgrades, while giving greater control to KyberDAO. The KNC Migration Process has begun at 20th April, 2021 with no hard deadline at this moment (Aug 2021). Migration ratio is 1:1 (1 old KNC will be migrated to 1 new ERC-20 KNC token) To avoid confusion, it is recommended that the old token be labelled as KNC Legacy (KNCL) and the new token will retain the original ticker KNC. KNC remains an ERC-20 token.  For KNC holders managing their own tokens on self-custodial wallets such as Metamask, Krystal, Ledger, Trezor, Keystore etc. you can convert to the new KNC token on your own via the Migration Portal on kyber.org/migrate IMPORTANT: Please make sure not to transfer KNCL tokens to a centralized exchange that only support upgraded KNC. Doing so might result in a loss of funds.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Axie Infinity (AXS)? Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that is partially owned and operated by its players. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Axie Infinity . Inspired by popular games like Pokémon and Tamagotchi, Axie Infinity allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies. These Axies can take various forms, and there are more than 500 different body parts available, including aquatic, beast, bird, bug, plant and reptile parts. Parts from each type class come in four different rarity scales: common, rare, ultra rare and legendary — and Axies can have any combination of body parts, making them highly variable and often rare and unique. Each Axie is a  non-fungible token  (NFT) with different attributes and strengths and can be entered into 3v3 battles, with the winning team earning more experience (exp) points that are used to level up an Axie's stats or evolve their body parts. These Axies can be bred together to produce new and unique offspring, which can be used or sold on the Axie marketplace. The Axie Infinity ecosystem also has its own unique  governance token , known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). These are used to participate in key governance votes and will give holders a say in how funds in the Axie Community Treasury are spent. Who Are the Founders of Axie Infinity? Axie Infinity was created in 2018 by Sky Mavis — a technology-focused game developer with a team primarily based in Vietnam. It was co-founded by Trung Nguyen and Aleksander Larsen. Trung Nguyen is the current CEO of the platform. Nguyen graduated with a BS in computer software engineering, and worked as a software engineer at Anduin Transactions prior to founding Axie Infinity. Former competitive gamer Aleksander Larsen is also credited as a co-founder and COO of the platform. Larsen has been working in  blockchain  gaming since 2017. He previously worked as the executive security officer for the Norwegian Government Security Organization and still sits as Secretary of the Board of Directors at the Blockchain Game Alliance. In total, the Axie Infinity team consists of 25 full-time employees — many of whom have experience with game development. What Makes Axie Infinity Unique? Each Axie possesses six out of the hundreds of different potential body parts — each of which has its own battle move. This produces essentially endless variety among Axies, with most Axies having relatively weak statistics, while those with the strongest combination of body parts can have incredible stats. Unlike some other blockchain-based battling and breeding games, each Axie can only be bred a total of seven times to help control the population of Axies. Axie Infinity has its own mating hub to help players find a suitable match to breed their Axie with to stand the best chance at producing a rare or powerful offspring. It costs 0.005 ETH in addition to Small Love Potion (SLP) tokens to breed Axies. AXS token holders will soon be able to  stake  their tokens to receive regular rewards. But unlike some other stakeable assets, AXS holders will also need to vote and play to claim their rewards.

Axie Infinity (AXS) tokens have a total supply of 270 million tokens. Out of this, around 53.5 million tokens were in circulation as of mid-November 2020. In total, 11% of the total supply was allocated to participants in the  Binance Launchpad   IEO  sale (each Axie Infinity token price was $0.10) and 4% was sold in a private sale. In addition to this, 29% is allocated for staking rewards, 20% to the  play-to-earn  pool, 21% to the team, 7% to advisors and 8% to the ecosystem fund. Based on the current release schedule, as indicated by  Binance Research , 100% of AXS tokens will be circulating by early 2026. How Is the Axie Infinity Network Secured? The Axie Infinity (AXS) token is an  ERC-20  token launched on the  Ethereum  blockchain. As a result, it is secured by Ethereum’s  proof-of-work  (POW) consensus mechanism. In early 2021, Axie Infinity plans to migrate its NFT tokens, including Axies, Land and other in-game item tokens from the Loom Network to a custom-built  sidechain  on Ethereum known as Ronin. Ronin is an application-specific sidechain built just for Axie Infinity. It is being developed by Sky Mavis — the development firm behind the Axie Infinity game, and is designed to support almost instant transaction confirmations, reduced gas fees and be capable of helping Axie Infinity scale. Where Can You Buy Axie Infinity (AXS)? As of October 2021, Axie Infinity (AXS) is available to trade on numerous exchange platforms, including top exchanges like:  Binance ,  Huobi Global ,  Coinbase ,  FTX ,  Bithumb ,  KuCoin ,  Gate.io  and  Kraken .

Launched in early November of 2020 by a team based in the United Kingdom, NFTLootBox is an NFT farming platform that combines NFT, DeFi, and Loot Box Technology to make NFT farming fairer.  NFT farming in its current state is not fair. There is both a high prevalence and potential for unethical behavior. Individuals close to or even working for NFT projects are given early notice on NFT releases before the community, bots claiming NFTs in less than a second before the majority of users even have the chance, individuals executing denial of service (DDOS) attacks on websites to claim rare NFTs before others, etc.  Additionally, many individuals simply do not have the time in their schedule to claim or start farming new NFTs. The NFT market is largely international, many users live in different timezones and might be sleeping, working, or spending time with friends or loved ones while the opportunity to start farming for valuable NFTs arises. It’s a first-come, first-served world where dishonest users can take shortcuts to get ahead and legitimate users are often burned. The solution? NFTLootbox.  The platform gives a fair chance for all users to obtain rare and valuable NFT art alongside cryptocurrency prizes and more.

Nectar was originally launched in 2017 by the Bitfinex spin-off exchange, Ethfinex — a team based out of London, UK — with the purpose of rewarding market makers for the value they create whilst simultaneously serving as the primary voting mechanism, allowing traders to govern the exchange and decide, among other things, which tokens they wish to see listed next. The project was designed to experiment with and develop novel governance processes with the aim of solving pain points seen with centralized exchanges including opaque and costly token listing procedures.  In August 2019, Ethfinex evolved into DeversiFi, bringing with it an overhaul of the Nectar token. Nectar now serves as the native utility and governance token of decentralised exchange DeversiFi. NEC 2.0 features a buy & burn mechanism, DeversiFi trading fee-discounts, and promotes participation from the wider Blockchain ecosystem through the NecDAO — launching in December 2019 with a reported ~ 17,500ETH constituted for the community-driven allocation of funds and governance of both DeversiFi and Nectar.community.

Founded in Singapore in Dec 2014, DigixDAO (DGD) is building a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that specializes in the tokenization of physical assets. The project provides the infrastructure to create tokens backed by physical assets on the blockchain. To wit, it allows for the public verification of an asset’s existence through its chain of custody via its Proof of Provenance (PoP) protocol, which makes use of the Ethereum network and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).  Digix also offers an API that enables other applications to be built on top of its asset tokenization service.  Digix has 2 cryptocurrencies, Digix Gold (DGX) and DigixDAO (DGD).  The company reportedly procures its gold from LBMA-approved refiners. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. The DGD crowdsale in Mar 2016 was the first crowdsale and major DAO hosted on the Ethereum network. Here are some other articles that you may be interested in: What Is a Crypto Faucet?

As tokens are already being used for a wide range of purposes, many specialized blockchains have been developed with native intent to support tokens, the most common of which is currently Ethereum and their ERC standard tokens. Socios.com is an app primarily for football (soccer) fans, where users acquire voting rights to influence the clubs they support by acquiring club-specific Fan tokens.  How do Fan tokens work? Chiliz ($CHZ)  is an ERC20 utility token on the Ethereum blockchain that serves as the digital currency for the chiliZ and Socios.com platform. In launching their platform, alongside other sports blockchain ventures, a new category of token has emerged — the Fan Token. Once onboard the Socios.com platform, yet to-be-announced club partners host what has been called a Fan Token Offering (FTO). Fans must purchase $CHZ via a cryptocurrency  exchange  in order to acquire Fan Tokens. These tokens — which are specific to a team or club — are a finite, digital asset that provide access to an encrypted ledger of voting and membership rights ownership. About Club Atletico Independiente Independiente are among the most successful football clubs of all time, having won 21 International competitions throughout their history, including a record 7 Copa Libertadores.

  "content": "JST Price Live Data The live  JUST price today  is $0.086310 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $389,190,998 USD.   We update our JST to USD price in real-time.   JUST is up 1.29% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #325, with a live market cap of $195,088,787 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 2,260,326,706 JST coins   and a max. supply of 9,900,000,000 JST coins. If you would like to know where to buy  JUST , the top exchanges for trading in  JUST  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is JUST (JST)? JUST is a popular new decentralized finance ( DeFi ) ecosystem built for the  TRON   blockchain . It is an entire suite of products that are mostly centered around a decentralized stablecoin lending platform known as JustStable.  The platform launched in August 2020 following an initial exchange offering (IEO) on the Poloniex LaunchBase platform earlier that same year, but the native governance token of the platform (JST) has been circulating since May 2020.  It is a two-token ecosystem built around the USDJ and JUST (JST) tokens.  USDJ  is a multi-collateral  stablecoin  that has its value pegged to the value of the US dollar (USD), whereas JST has a variety of functions on the platform — paying interest, helping maintain the platform and participating in its governance, helping to set parameters like interest rates (stability fees) and the minimum collateralization ratio.  To obtain USDJ on JUST, traders need to deposit collateral in the form of supported collateral tokens — including TRON (TRX), which are exchanged to PTRX tokens and locked as collateral forming a collateralized debt position (CDP). Depending on the amount of collateral deposited, users can then mint and withdraw USDJ, which must later be repaid to retrieve the initial collateral.  The platform is designed to provide a fair and borderless hub of  DeFi  products, that any TRON user can access.  Who Are the Founders of JUST? The JUST ecosystem is managed by the JUST Foundation, which includes individuals from Alibaba, Tencent, IBM and \"other world-class internet companies,\" while JUST's financial analysis team hails from \"several global investment banks\" according to the project website. Some of the most prominent individuals include Terance F (a blockchain expert and ex-Barclays and IBM employee), Elvis Zhang (a senior developer and experienced blockchain researcher), C Wu (a specialist in wallets and exchanges) and GL Kong (an experienced blockchain engineer and early crypto adopter). The full names and profiles of much of the JUST team is not public. However, it appears that the project shares some overlap with the TRON development team, since the platform was announced by TRON CEO and founder Justin Sun, and has received technical and financial support from TRON.  What Makes JUST Unique? Unlike most other DeFi platforms, JUST isn’t just looking to offer a single product that offers utility to a small subset of DeFi users. Instead, it’s attempting to build an entire suite of products that cover a range of DeFi use cases, forming the foundations of a complete DeFi ecosystem on TRON.  As of January 2021, the JUST ecosystem consists of five distinct products, all of which are designed to interoperate and provide additional utility to users.  These are: JustStable:  JUST’s flagship decentralized multi-collateral stablecoin platform. JustLend:  A TRON-powered money market protocol that allows users to add  liquidity  to lending pools and take out low-interest cryptocurrency loans. JustSwap:  An automated market maker ( AMM ) platform used for trustless TRC-20 token swaps and the creation of permissionless liquidity pools. JustLink:  The first decentralized  oracle  system for the TRON network — used to securely supply smart contracts with real-world data. Cross-chain tokens:  Assets from other blockchains, including Bitcoin (BTC),  Ethereum (ETH)  and  Litecoin  (LTC), that have been tokenized on TRON and can be used within the JUST ecosystem.

How Many JUST (JST) Coins Are There in Circulation? As of January 2021, a total of 2.26 billion JST is in circulation, out of a maximum supply of 9.9 billion. This represents 23% of the maximum supply. These tokens are earned by depositing, lending, and providing liquidity on the JUST Network or by completing several other actions — such as by participating in special campaigns.  According to the original  IEO  on Poloniex, the full JST token supply is distributed as follows: Seed Sale: 11% Public Sale (LaunchBase Allocation): 4% Strategic Partnerships: 26% Team: 19% Airdrop (Only for TRX Holders): 10% Ecosystem: 30% Further information about the allocation of JST tokens, including the specifics of the vesting period for the JUST team and its inflation rate is currently unknown. However, it is known that all team tokens will be fully vested by April 2022.  How Is the JUST Network Secured? As a TRC-20 token, the JUST Network is secured by the underlying TRON blockchain.  Unlike other platforms that use the energy-intensive  proof-of-work  (POW)  consensus  mechanism to maintain the integrity of the blockchain and ward off potential  attacks , TRON uses the energy-efficient delegated-proof-of-stake ( dPOS ) system. This sees TRON (TRX) token holders elect super representatives tasked with generating blocks and packaging transactions. Together, the 27 super representatives are responsible for keeping the network secure.  Where Can You Buy JUST (JST)? The JUST (JST) token is highly liquid and can be traded on some of the most well-reputed exchange platforms around — including  Binance , Poloniex,  OKEx  and Bithumb. As of January 2021, the most popular trading pairs for JST include JST/USDT, JST/KRW and JST/BTC. A handful of cryptocurrency exchanges also support direct fiat purchases of JST.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . Grin is a minimalistic, lightweight cryptocurrency, implementing the  Mimblewimble  protocol for a unique balance of privacy and scalability. The chain has no addresses, no amounts, and no need to store data of spent outputs. Grin is fully open-source and community-driven. There is no single entity behind it, Grin’s development is funded by donations as well as done voluntarily by contributors. Everybody can discuss, influence, or work on its development. Grin’s blocktime is 1 minute, each with a coinbase reward of 60 grins, thus creating 1 unit per second, forever. This linear emission creates a constant increase in supply, but a decreasing rate of inflation; making the emission disinflationary. This simple design serves to ensure both the long term security of the chain and a fair process of coin distribution to all participants. In Aug 2016, an anonymous person using the nickname ‘majorplayer’, signed onto a Bitcoin research IRC channel, dropped a link to a document, then signed out. The document titled ‘Mimblewimble’ was authored under the pseudonym Tom Elvis Jedusor. Several developers took an interest, one of them being Andrew Poelstra, who later published a paper which added several refinements and a detailed technical description of the original whitepaper. In Oct 2016, a developer under the pseudonym Ignotus Peverell began work on developing an implementation of the protocol and was soon joined by others in an effort to build the project which ultimately came to be known as Grin. It was launched on January 15th, 2019. Our most recent articles about  Grin : Cryptocurrency Money Laundering What Are Privacy Coins? What Is GPU Mining? What Is Mimblewimble?

VeriCoin describes itself as purely a digital currency that runs on its own protocol known as Proof-of-Stake-Time (PoST).  Proof of Stake Time rewards investors with variable and compounding interest payments on the coins held within their wallets in return for leaving Vericoin's digital wallet open and running on their computer, a process known as \"staking\". Staking, incentivized through interest payments, validates transactions on the VeriCoin network.  VeriCoin transactions are reportedly nearly instant (currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin). The team claims that -- upon the upcoming launch of the binary chain that pairs VeriCoin with Verium Reserve -- network transaction speeds will increase exponentially. The Dual Blockchain (or Binary-Chain) pairs a digital currency (VeriCoin) with a digital reserve (Verium). It reportedly secures and accelerates transactions by leveraging complementary protocol technologies (Proof-of-Stake-Time and Proof-of-Work-Time), into a blockchain system. The goal is to offer a comprehensive solution to ensure low cost, secure, fast, and scalable digital transactions. Here are some other articles that you may be interested in: What Is a Crypto Faucet?

  "content": "CORE Price Live Data The live  cVault.finance price today  is $9,645.15 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $89,584.61 USD.   We update our CORE to USD price in real-time.   cVault.finance is down 2.87% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #461, with a live market cap of $96,451,503 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 10,000 CORE coins   and the max. supply is not available. What Is cVault.finance (CORE)? CVault.finance is a  decentralized finance  protocol with a deflationary governance token, CORE, that users can  stake  and use to  yield farm . The platform also plans to  introduce  \"Automated Strategy Vaults,\" which will allow for the automatic execution of profit-generating strategies for staked tokens. Aiming to be completely decentralized, cVault.finance  calls  its governance model \"the strongest and most involved in DeFi.\" CORE token holders vote as a community to implement changes to the protocol, including the creation of new  liquidity pools  or the elimination of existing ones. The platform was  launched  on the Ethereum mainnet in September 2020, with CORE  debuting  on Uniswap seven days later. Who Are the Founders of cVault.finance? CVault.finance was launched in September 2020 by two pseudonymous developers known as \"0xRevert\" and \"X 3.\" The two have a  history  of working in traditional software development, but cVault.finance is their  first  crypto-related project. The co-founders have stated that they decided to create the platform after  witnessing  DeFi yield farming operations \"fantastically implode due to poor economic decisions\" such as minting new tokens as part of the farming process. In October 2020, cVault.finance  brought on  another pseudonymous individual, \"0xdec4f,\" to join its leadership team as head of operations. Prior to assuming an official role with cVault.finance, 0xdec4f was an active community member and moderator of the platform's Telegram channel. What Makes cVault.finance Unique? The main way in which cVault.finance seeks to differentiate itself from other DeFi protocols is through its focus on deflationary yield farming. The project believes that minting new tokens to reward  liquidity providers  — a process carried out by many DeFi protocols — is unsustainable in the long term, as it devalues the token. It has  referred to  this form of incentivization as \"flawed and short minded.\" CVault.finance offers what it  calls  \"deflationary farming\" in which no new tokens are ever minted. Rather, a 1% fee is charged on token transfers, and the fees are used to reward liquidity providers. In addition, the protocol prevents the withdrawal of  liquidity  from Uniswap, which it says guarantees a stable market. These built-in measures, it argues, will ensure the sustainability of the platform. The cVault.finance development team receives 7% of token transfer fees, while the remaining 93% is redistributed as rewards to liquidity providers.

Stay up to date on DeFi, yield farming and more with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many cVault.finance (CORE) Coins Are There in Circulation? CVault.finance has a fixed supply of 10,000 tokens. All 10,000 CORE was minted in September 2020 during the project's initial seven-day \"liquidity generation event,\" or LGE, during which participants  contributed  over 3,759  Ether  (ETH) — valued at $1.41 million at the time — that was used to  create  a CORE/ETH Uniswap liquidity pool, with contributors receiving liquidity pool tokens. A second LGE was  held  in October 2020, this time accepting  Wrapped Bitcoin  (WBTC) and receiving over $5 million in value. The project plans to hold a third event centered around a  stablecoin . Unlike typical Uniswap pairs, these LP tokens cannot be redeemed for their underlying asset, thus permanently locking liquidity into the protocol. This has led to the creation of a secondary market where users  trade  LP tokens for other assets. The development team of cVault.finance has also stated that this results in a so-called \"price floor,\" meaning that CORE can never drop below a certain price. According to cVault.finance, the development team  does not  receive any CORE tokens as a part of its LGEs. How Is the cVault.finance Network Secured? CORE is an  ERC-20  token — although it has  proposed  a new ERC-95 standard — meaning that it relies on the Ethereum  blockchain  to validate CORE transactions. Ethereum uses a  proof-of-work   consensus  algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted. According to co-founder X 3, because cVault.finance's liquidity generation events use open-source  smart contracts  and liquidity is permanently locked in Uniswap, there is  no way  for the developers to carry out a \"rug-pulling\" event in which the development team makes off with users' funds — thus making it more secure than other DeFi projects. The project's smart contract was  audited  in October 2020 by blockchain software development and security consulting company The Arcadia Group. The firm found that while there were no critical security flaws that required immediate attention, there were some fixes that could be implemented to improve security. The cVault.finance team also  announced  in October 2020 that it was offering a $50,000 bug bounty for community members who find flaws in its upcoming changes to its code. Where Can You Buy cVault.finance (CORE)? CORE is primarily exchanged on  Uniswap (V2) , although it is also listed on Bilaxy and Hotbit. It can be traded against  Ether ,  WETH  (WETH),  Tether  (USDT) and  Bitcoin  (BTC). Are you interested in buying CORE or other  cryptocurrencies  such as BTC?

We update our BZRX to USD price in real-time.   bZx Protocol is down 1.43% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #369, with a live market cap of $151,684,676 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 340,151,504 BZRX coins   and a max. supply of 1,030,000,000 BZRX coins. If you would like to know where to buy  bZx Protocol , the top exchanges for trading in  bZx Protocol  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   CoinTiger ,   KuCoin ,    and   ZT .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is BZx Protocol (BZRX)? The bZx protocol is an  Ethereum -based decentralized platform built for  DeFi  lending and margin and leverage trading that differentiates itself from competitors through a smart contract-powered token system. Launched in 2018, offers two types of financial primitives, iTokens and pTokens, through its Fulcrum and Torque DeFi platform. BZx’s trading front-end Fulcrum allows users to trade and or lend crypto assets through tokenized loans (iTokens) and tokenized positions (pTokens). Torque serves as bZx’s lending front-end web interface, allowing users to borrow funds for any purpose at a fixed interest rate.  The bZx system has 3 core  ERC20  tokens: iTokens, pTokens and BZRX tokens, which each play an essential role in how bZx functions. In July 2020, bZX launched its native token BZXR in an Initial DEX Offering (IDO), on the  Uniswap exchange. Who Are the Founders of BZx? BzX was founded by Tom Bean, a former Nokia engineer, and Kyle Kistner, a former researcher, both from Georgia, USA, who came up with the concept in August 2017 and published their white paper in February 2018. They respectively launched Fulcrum and Torque in June and October 2019. The bZx team currently has 13 members and a list of influential partners and collaborators, including Chainlink, Kyber Network, Augur, Maker, DeFi Pulse, Signal Ventures and Deversifi.  What Makes BZx Protocol Unique? BZx’s value proposition to DeFi users can be described as “everything is tokenized.” The protocol offers incentivized  yield farming  by refunding active users with 50% of the fees they pay in the form of BZRX.  This differentiates them from other liquidity mining protocols, which often offer exponential token rewards that dwarf the actual value of fees paid to the protocol. This oracle-based pricing method of only rewarding active users with tokens is considered a more sustainable model that adds more value to the protocol over the long term.  The protocol’s two financial primitives, iTokens and pTokens, are composable and can be used as collateral for loans or listed on exchanges. ITokens go up in value due to constant compound interest earned, while pTokens are issued to represent short and long leveraged margin trading positions. Lenders who act as  liquidity providers  automatically receive iTokens for adding funds to liquidity pools, which can be exchanged at any time for their original funds plus accumulated interest.  BZX users who borrow funds to do margin trading on Fulcrum automatically receive various types of pTokens (“position tokens”), based on the liquidity pool they trade on, such as ETH-USDT, LINK-DAI or AAVE-USDC. Read more on how their  pTokens work here .  Moreover, Fulcrum users don’t need to register or pay transaction fees and can use most Ethereum wallets like MetaMask to connect to the protocol.

How Many BZx Protocol (BZRX) Coins Are There in Circulation? bZx has a total supply of 1,030,000,000 BZRX tokens, with a current circulating supply of 140 million tokens.  BZRX  tokens  are to be distributed as follows: Vesting (21.35%), Presale (13.65%), Team (20%), Builder Fund (20%), Security and Alignment Fund (5%) and Ecosystem Fund (20%). Of the 20% allocated to reward users, 17% will go towards fee rebates and 3% to the protocol’s usage.  How Is the BZx Network Secured? The bZx protocol has been plagued by security flaws which resulted in three hacks in 2020. Despite having their smart contracts audited by firms such as Peckshield and Certik, the last hack in September resulted in an $8 million exploit due to  “one misplaced line of code”  that allowed hackers to duplicate assets. Impacted users were refunded in full by the Fulcrum “black swan” insurance fund.  The bZx team is working with developers and auditors to improve security and network upgrades are constantly rolled out.  Where Can You Buy bZx Protocol (BZRX) ?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Energy Web Token (EWT)? Energy Web Token (EWT) is the operational token behind the Energy Web Chain, a  blockchain -based virtual machine designed to support and further application development for the energy sector.  Energy Web Chain was launched in June 2019. The Energy Web Foundation is the non-profit enterprise behind the project. EWT aims to bring diversity to the energy sector by allowing developers to create decentralized applications ( DApps ). The virtual machine has the potential to benefit actors from all areas of energetics, including grid operators, software developers, and vendors. Who Are the Founders of Energy Web Token? Energy Web Token is a joint project between Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and Grid Singularity (GSy).  Rocky Mountain Institute ( RMI ) is a leading name in research and development in the energy sector. As a prominent think tank, RMI has participated in many revolutionary projects in the energy sector. By creating the Energy Web Chain, RMI wanted to employ blockchain technology’s decentralized power to allow actors from the energy sector to develop new decentralized solutions.  Grid Singularity ( GSy ) brought blockchain expertise to the project. As a blockchain developer, GSy was the powerhouse behind the creation of the Energy Web Chain. With renowned experts, core  Ethereum  blockchain developers, experienced energy executives, and energy regulators, GSy was an integral part for EWT to launch.  What Makes Energy Web Token Unique? When creating the Energy Web Chain, founders RMI and GSy were looking to launch a versatile blockchain solution for a wide range of applications in the energy sector. One of the main selling points of EWT is that it offers enterprises the opportunity to create completely customized decentralized apps. While blockchains like Ethereum also provide this diversity, Energy Web Chain was purposefully designed for the energy sector.  Considering the fact that the Energy Web Chain is created with enterprise use in mind, it supports state-of-the-art scalability and data privacy. The foundation also recently released a stacked tech solution called Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS). It allows users to control and manage their electrical systems online.  The Energy Web Token is currently placed at one hundred and second place according to the CoinMarketCap token  ranking  as of February 2021.  Related Pages: Find out more about  Power Ledger . Check out  Restart Energy MWAT . Read more about  Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) . Visit the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Energy Web Token (EWT) Coins Are There in Circulation? The Energy Web Foundation plans to release a maximum supply of 100,000,000 EWT tokens over ten years after the initial release date. Currently, there are 48,638,535 EWT tokens available on the market for trading.  Out of the total supply, 14,093,276 tokens were distributed to the Energy Web Team as an endowment. Another 10,000,000 ETW tokens were given to two founding organizations; however, there is a waiting period until June 2021, when these tokens will become tradable. A further 4,061,709 tokens were dedicated to a community fund, which should continue increasing over ten years.  How Is the Energy Web Token Network Secured? The Energy Web virtual machine operates under a proof-of-authority ( PoA ) consensus. This means that the blockchain relies on trusted validators for the creation of new blocks. The PoA consensus is an alternative validation method, and it allows faster processing times than the proof-of-work ( PoW ) consensus.  While the EWT coin is not an  ERC-20  token, the Energy Web team has created the alternative EWT Bridged (EWTB) token, allowing EWT coins to be transferred to the  Ehtereum  mainnet. This makes the EWT coin extraordinarily versatile and allows for interoperability across different blockchains.  Where Can You Buy Energy Web Token (EWT)? As the Energy Web Token is rising in popularity, it is becoming increasingly available across a wide range of exchanges. The top-rated exchange for EWT trading is  KuCoin , with an EWT/USD trading volume of $383,098. Next up is  Liquid  with an EWT/BTC trading volume of $173,637. Last but not least, EWT is becoming more popular on  Hotbit , with an EWT/BTC trading volume of $65,375. It is important to note that investing in EWT carries a risk, just like any other type of investment. Read more  about buying cryptocurrency.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Stratis (STRAX)? Stratis is a blockchain-as-a-service platform that offers several products and services for enterprises, including launching private sidechains, running full nodes, developing and deploying  smart contracts , an initial coin offering platform, and a proof-of-identity application. The company also provides  cryptocurrency  wallets and  blockchain  consulting services. Stratis operates its own blockchain powered by a native token, STRAX, used to purchase and operate services such as executing smart contracts, paying for sidechains, and  staking  as collateral to operate a Masternode --- a node on the network that provides a specific needed service. The platform was first  announced  in June 2016, and it  launched  in August 2016. In November 2020, Stratis  deployed  a new blockchain that uses STRAX instead of its previous STRAT token. Who Are the Founders of Stratis? Stratis Group Ltd., the company behind the Stratis platform, was founded in 2016 by Chris Trew. He started the company with the purpose of developing an enterprise-focused blockchain platform, which he  felt  was missing from the industry at the time. He decided to base the platform on the  Bitcoin  (BTC) protocol, believing that Bitcoin would become dominant in the crypto space --- meaning that its codebase would be consistently improved over time. Before starting Stratis, Trew's background was in enterprise information technology. He  taught  himself the programming language C# and spent 10 years serving in various IT roles in the legal, aviation and public sectors as well as with financial institutions such as Barclays. He also  operated  an internet marketing and search engine optimization business. Within the crypto and blockchain industry, Trew  was  a volunteer developer for the cryptocurrency project Blitz and social networking platform The Viral Exchange. What Makes Stratis Unique? According to its  whitepaper , the Stratis BaaS platform is  designed  for financial service providers and other enterprises to test, develop and deploy blockchain-based applications in a way that avoids the overhead and security concerns of operating their own networks. To do so, Stratis offers businesses the opportunity to run permissioned, private sidechains that interact with its primary chain, as well as to host  decentralized applications , launch smart contracts and utilize various privacy and identity verification tools. Its whitepaper argues that this approach gives enterprises the freedom to completely customize their platforms without the limitations of relying on a major blockchain, such as Bitcoin or  Ethereum  (ETH). Stratis has announced business partnerships with companies such as software giant  Microsoft , technology markets intelligence firm  International Data Corporation , and pharmaceutical blockchain development company  MediConnect , among  others . In addition, it has  sponsored  professional athletes as a way to raise awareness of the platform. With the launch of its new STRAX-based blockchain in November 2020, Stratis  unveiled  an updated development roadmap for the end of 2020 and the first half of 2021. It includes interoperability with Ethereum, an Internet of Things software development kit, a  decentralized finance  software library, the launch of a  decentralized autonomous organization , and more.

How Many Stratis (STRAX) Coins Are There in Circulation? Stratis launched its first STRAT token with a total supply of 98 million, with 84 million STRAT (85.7%)  sold  during an  initial coin offering  that ended in July 2016 and  raised  915 BTC ---  worth  nearly $600,000 at the time. Of the remaining supply, 8 million STRAT (8.2%) was reserved for the Stratis team, 2 million STRAT (2%) for advisors and partners, and 4 million STRAT (4.1%) for bounties and campaigns. In October 2020, Stratis  initiated  a token swap process for STRAT holders to exchange their tokens for STRAX at a one-to-one ratio. As a part of the transition, 25 million STRAX was newly minted, of which 8.125 million STRAX was  reserved  for the Stratis Foundation, 6.375 million STRAX for network incentivization, 5.5 million STRAX for enterprise incentivization, and 5 million for the Stratis DAO. The tokens will be issued over the course of five years. New STRAX is introduced through a  proof-of-stake  mining process, and each block produces a block reward of 18 STRAX, putting its annual inflation rate at around 10%. Half of the block reward is awarded to the block producer, while the other half is sent to its Cirrus sidechain and distributed to block-producing masternodes. How Is the Stratis Network Secured? The Stratis network is secured through its PoS  consensus  protocol in which nodes must stake STRAX to participate in the block validation process, and the more STRAX staked, the greater the chance of being able to create a block. According to Stratis, this  makes  the network more secure because the more STRAX a user stakes, the less likely they are to want to manipulate the network, as they risk losing their stake or causing the value of their stake to plummet. A majority of nodes must agree that a transaction is accurate for it to be added to the blockchain. With the launch of its STRAX-based blockchain in November 2020, Stratis announced new security-enhancing features, including the ability to \"cold-stake\" --- stake STRAX through an offline, cold wallet --- which it argued will increase network security by enabling more users to participate in the consensus process. It also reported that it would activate Segregated Witness, or SegWit, which will increase transaction security because transaction IDs are no longer malleable. While Stratis is a private company, its blockchain's codebase is open source, meaning that it is  available  for community audit. Where Can You Buy Stratis (STRAX)? STRAX can be purchased on exchanges such as  Binance ,  Upbit  and  Bithumb . It can be traded on spot markets against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  and  Ether , and  stablecoins  such as  Tether  (USDT) and  Binance USD  (BUSD).

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA)? Bitcoin Cash ABC is a  blockchain  and cryptocurrency  created  on Nov. 15, 2020, as a result of a hard fork in the  Bitcoin Cash  (BCH) blockchain that split the original chain into two new chains, provisionally called \"Bitcoin Cash ABC\" and \"Bitcoin Cash Node.\" The latter retained the existing Bitcoin Cash name and ticker, while at the time of the fork, Bitcoin Cash ABC had not yet  announced  new branding. Bitcoin Cash ABC is based on the Bitcoin Cash protocol, which is itself a fork of the original  Bitcoin  (BTC) protocol. It is focused on providing a fast, highly scalable, global  cryptocurrency  in a manner that is sustainable in the long term. Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin Cash ABC? Bitcoin Cash ABC was first  announced  in 2017 by Amaury Séchet, also known as \"Deadalnix,\" as a software solution for operating a Bitcoin Cash full node. Séchet was highly active in the development of Bitcoin Cash, leading its initial fork away from Bitcoin in August 2017, its continuation after  Bitcoin SV  (BSV) was forked from it in November 2018, and its most recent fork from Bitcoin Cash in November 2020. As lead developer of Bitcoin Cash ABC, which provided Bitcoin Cash network infrastructure, he was responsible for driving much of the development of Bitcoin Cash. Séchet first became involved with Bitcoin in 2011, later deciding to diverge from it due to what he believed was its inability to sufficiently scale. Prior to working on Bitcoin Cash ABC, he was a software engineer at Facebook, was involved in the LLMV language compiler project, and was lead developer for Stupid D Compiler, a D compiler commonly known as SDC. He previously worked with another Bitcoin Cash node software, Bitcoin Unlimited, which he  left  in May 2019. What Makes Bitcoin Cash ABC Unique? As a fork of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Cash ABC retains many of the same characteristics. Its main  goal  is to create money that is \"usable by everyone in the world\" and that will \"dramatically increase human freedom and prosperity.\" It uses a larger block size than Bitcoin as a way to increase transaction times and scalability. Bitcoin Cash ABC  introduced  two main changes to its protocol that differentiate it from Bitcoin Cash: a new mining difficulty adjustment algorithm known as Aserti3--2d, or ASERT, and a requirement that 8% of all newly minted BCHA be allocated to fund the further development of the network. The second change, known as the \"coinbase rule,\" proved to be controversial and was a primary contributor to the fork. However, Séchet has argued that having a self-funding mechanism is in line with the original vision of Bitcoin. Fifty percent of the BCHA raised through the coinbase rule goes to the development team to fund its continued operations and strategic initiatives, which  include  establishing adaptive block sizes, overhauling the mempool, hiring new staff and more. The remaining 50% goes to the Global Network Council, a governance system through which developers, miners and major token holders can  vote  on how the funds should be reinvested into the ecosystem.

Want more background? Read an  in-depth analysis  of what led up to the fork on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource. Stay up to date on the latest blockchain and crypto developments with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) Coins Are There in Circulation? Bitcoin Cash ABC has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million BCHA. BCHA tokens were first introduced in November 2020 at the time of its fork from Bitcoin Cash. After the fork occurred, all BCH token holders automatically owned an equal amount of BCHA. This resulted in many exchanges --- including  Binance ,  OKEx ,  Upbit ,  Kucoin  and  Houbi Global  --- listing the token and airdropping BCHA into the wallets of BCH token holders. New BCHA is introduced into circulation in form of block rewards through the blockchain's  proof-of-work  consensus and  SHA-265  mining algorithms. Eight percent of all block rewards are reserved for network and ecosystem development, while the remaining 92% is distributed to miners. Every 210,000 blocks, the blockchain undergoes a  halving , which reduces the block reward by 50%. How Is the Bitcoin Cash ABC Network Secured? The Bitcoin Cash ABC network is secured using a proof-of-work  consensus  algorithm --- the same as is used by Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin. At least 51% of all full nodes in the network must agree that a transaction is valid in order for it to be posted, and new blocks are added to the blockchain through the mining process, in which users compete among one another to solve complex, energy-intensive problems under a SHA-265 mining algorithm. In addition, Bitcoin Cash ABC founder Séchet has argued that by using a self-funding revenue model under the coinbase rule, the security of the network is further enhanced, as now miners and developers alike are incentivized to protect the network because their income depends on it. Upon achieving a stable revenue stream, Bitcoin Cash ABC has  stated  it intends to hire more staff to be able to better address security vulnerabilities. Where Can You Buy Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA)? BCHA is available to purchase on exchanges such as  Binance ,  Upbit ,  CoinEx  and  MXC.COM , among others. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the South Korean won, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  and  Bitcoin Cash , and  stablecoins  such as  Tether  (USDT) and  Binance USD  (BUSD). All those who held BCH at the time of the fork automatically own an equal amount of BCHA as well. Are you interested in buying BCHA or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin ?

THORChain is up 2.27% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #47, with a live market cap of $4,310,605,508 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 258,210,215 RUNE coins   and a max. supply of 500,000,000 RUNE coins. If you would like to know where to buy  THORChain , the top exchanges for trading in  THORChain  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   CoinTiger ,   FTX ,    and   KuCoin .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is THORChain (RUNE)? THORCHain is a decentralized liquidity protocol that allows users to easily exchange cryptocurrency assets across a range of networks without losing full custody of their assets in the process.  With THORChain, users can simply swap one asset for another in a permissionless setting, without needing to rely on order books to source liquidity. Instead, market prices are maintained through the ratio of assets in a pool (see  automated market maker ). The native utility token of the THORChain platform is RUNE. This is used as the base currency in the THORChain ecosystem and is also used for platform governance and security as part of THORChain's Sybil resistance mechanisms — since THORChain nodes must commit a minimum of 1 million RUNE to participate in its rotating  consensus  process.  THORChain was funded through an initial DEX offering (IDO) which launched through the Binance  DEX  in July 2019. Its mainnet originally launched in January 2021, but a multi-chain upgrade is currently scheduled for 2021. Who Are the Founders of THORChain? According to an official representative of THORChain, the platform has no CEO, no founder and no directors. Instead, the further development of the platform is organized through Gitlab. On top of this, those currently working on the project are largely anonymous. Again, an official representative of THORChain states that this is to \"protect the project and ensure that it can decentralize.\" A  tweet  by the project sheds some light on the theory behind maintaining a project with an anonymous team, as quoted below: “-> Developers work for the Nodes, by shipping code that makes the system more valuable.  -> Nodes work for the Stakers, by securing assets and being online. -> Stakers bring capital, placed on-market for the Swappers. -> Swappers pay fees, bringing economic activity.” What Makes THORChain Unique? THORChain uses a unique system to help mitigate the issue of  “impermanent losses”  — or the often temporary losses that a liquidity provider can experience when contributing to liquidity pools. It achieves this by using a slip-based fee to help ensure liquidity stays where it is needed. On top of this, THORChain combines a range of novel technologies, including on-way state pegs, a state machine, the Bifröst Signer Module and a TSS protocol to seamlessly facilitate cross-chain token swaps. This is all kept behind the scenes, making the platform accessible to even inexperienced traders.  The platform isn't profit-oriented. All fees generated by the protocol go directly to the users, and there are no provisions for the team. Instead, the team is incentivized by simply holding RUNE — just like everyone else. The RUNE token is currently available on multiple blockchains, including Binance Chain (as a BEP-2 token) and Ethereum (as an  ERC-20  token).

How Decentralized Are Decentralized Networks ? Find out with CoinMarketCap Alexandria. Have you seen the  CoinMarketCap blog  yet? How Many THORChain (RUNE) Coins Are There in Circulation? As of February 2021, there are 158.4 million RUNE in circulation out of a total supply of 500 million. As we touched on earlier, THORChain initially launched following an  IEO  on the Binance DEX. As part of the IEO, 20 million RUNE were sold. Prior to this, a total of 130 million RUNE were sold in earlier funding rounds.  According to the official  Binance DEX proposal , 10% of the total supply (50 million tokens) was allocated to the team, and locked until the launch of the mainnet — unlocking at 20% per month thereafter. THORChain currently has an emission curve starting at 30% APR. This is scheduled to target around 2% APR after ten years.  How Is the THORChain Network Secured? THORChain is built using the Cosmos SDK and is powered by the Tendermint consensus mechanism. This keeps the network safe from  attacks  through a novel  BFT  proof-of-stake ( PoS ) system that sees a large number of validators work together to propose and finalize blocks of transactions.  Beyond this, THORChain’s  smart contracts  have been audited by several third-party security firms, including one by Certik — which found no vulnerabilities.  Where Can You Buy THORChain (RUNE)? RUNE is a popular cryptocurrency that is available to purchase and trade on a large number of both centralized and decentralized exchange platforms.

If you would like to know where to buy  Cardano , the top exchanges for trading in  Cardano  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Cardano (ADA)? Cardano is a  proof-of-stake  blockchain platform that says its goal is to allow “changemakers, innovators and visionaries” to bring about positive global change. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Cardano . The open-source project also aims to “redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to individuals” — helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent and fair. Cardano was founded back in 2017, and named after the 16th century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano. The native ADA token takes its name from the 19th century mathematician Ada Lovelace, widely regarded as the world’s first computer programmer. The ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software. The team behind the layered blockchain say that there have already been some compelling use cases for its technology, which aims to allow decentralized apps and smart contracts to be developed with modularity. In August 2021, Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of the Alonzo hard fork, causing Cardano price to surge, gaining 116% in the following month. On Sept. 12, 2021, the Cardano ‘ Alonzo ’  hard fork  officially launched, bringing  smart contract  functionality to the blockchain. Over 100 smart contracts were deployed in the following 24 hours after the launch. Cardano is used by agricultural companies to track fresh produce from field to fork, while other products built on the platform allow educational credentials to be stored in a tamper-proof way, and retailers to clamp down on counterfeit goods. Who Are the Founders of Cardano? Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who was also one of the co-founders of the Ethereum network. He is the CEO of IOHK, the company that built Cardano’s blockchain. In an interview for  CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Titans series , Hoskinson said that he got involved in cryptocurrencies back in 2011 — and dabbled in mining and trading. He explained that his first professional involvement in the industry came in 2013, when he created a course about Bitcoin that ended up being taken by 80,000 students. As well as being a technology entrepreneur, Hoskinson is also a mathematician. In 2020, his technology company donated ADA worth $500,000 to the University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Research and Development Lab. What Makes Cardano Unique? Cardano is one of the biggest blockchains to successfully use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is less energy intensive than the proof-of-work algorithm relied upon by Bitcoin. Although the much larger Ethereum is going to be  upgrading  to PoS, this transition is only going to take place gradually. The project has taken pride in ensuring that all of the technology developed goes through a process of peer-reviewed research, meaning that bold ideas can be challenged before they are validated. According to the Cardano team, this academic rigor helps the blockchain to be durable and stable — increasing the chance that potential pitfalls can be anticipated in advance. In 2020, Cardano held a Shelley upgrade that aimed to make its blockchain “50 to 100 times more decentralized” than other large blockchains. At the time, Hoskinson predicted that this would pave the way for hundreds of assets to run on its network. The Alonzo hard fork launch in September 2021 will bring an end to the Shelley era, and usher in the Goguen phase. Users can develop and deploy smart contracts on Cardano, allowing native decentralized applications (DApps) to be built on blockchain. Cardano price broke the $3 mark and hit an all-time high of $3.101 on Sept. 2, 2021, ahead of the launch.

How Many Cardano (ADA) Coins Are There in Circulation? There is a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA — but at the time of writing, there was a circulating supply of about 31 billion. Five rounds of public sales of Cardano tokens were held between September 2015 and January 2017. Cardano price during its pre-launch sale was $0.0024, which represents an over 1000x return, given Cardano price now. Approximately 2.5 billion ADA was allotted to IOHK once the network launched. Meanwhile, an additional 2.1 billion ADA was given to Emurgo, a global blockchain technology company that served as a founding entity of the Cardano protocol. Last but not least, 648 million ADA was given to the not-for-profit Cardano Foundation, which aims to promote the platform and increase levels of adoption. Overall, about 16% of ADA’s total supply went to the project’s founders, with the remaining 84% being split among investors. How Is the Cardano Network Secured? Cardano is secured through an “environmentally sustainable, verifiably secure” PoS protocol that’s known as Ouroboros. The project says that Ouroboros improves upon the security guarantees that are delivered by a PoW consensus mechanism while using substantially less power — claiming that it is four times more energy efficient than Bitcoin. It is described as a blend of unique technology and mathematically verified mechanisms, with behavioral psychology and economic philosophy thrown in for good measure. Overall, the objective of Ouroboros is to achieve sustainable and ethical growth. An incentive mechanism means that participants in the network are rewarded for their involvement. What Is Cardano’s Alonzo Upgrade? On Sept. 12, Cardano released its highly-anticipated Alonzo upgrade. Following the upgrade, the blockchain network can now support a wide range of crypto applications, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts. According to the project’s founder Charles Hoskinson, Alonzo aims to introduce “programmability” to the network. He likened the upgrade to when JavaScript was introduced to web browsers and the transition from static web pages to the likes of Facebook and YouTube. Alonzo is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church, who is considered to be one of the founding fathers of computer science. In addition to supporting NFTs and smart contracts, Cardano can now be used for decentralized exchanges. In general, Alonzo puts Cardano in the same class as Ethereum, the world’s leading blockchain which supports other applications other than its native Ether token. Smart contracts, for instance, are one of the cornerstones of the decentralized finance sector — and Cardano now supports smart contracts. Where Can You Buy Cardano (ADA)? As one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world in terms of market capitalization, you shouldn’t have much difficulty in finding a major exchange to  buy Cardano  on including Binance, Bittrex, eToro, and HitBTC.

DiFy.Finance is down 5.43% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #1399, with a live market cap of $4,043,790 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 7,801 YFIII coins   and a max. supply of 30,000 YFIII coins. What Is DiFy.Finance (YFIII)? DiFy.Finance is an in-development software fork of yearn.finance (YFI) focused on mobile platform compatibility. DiFy.Finance, like  YFI , the platform it is based on, is an environment of decentralized finance ( DeFi ) lending aggregators: it allows users to provide  liquidity  for the ecosystem by parking their cryptocurrency tokens in a smart contract vault and earning interest in return. By the virtue of it being an aggregator of lending services, YFIII users are able to optimize their interest yields in an automated manner by frequently rebalancing their investments between available options. DiFy.Finance was launched on September 22, 2020, and was first listed on the  DigiFinex  exchange on September 28, 2020. Who Are the Founders of DiFy.Finance? As of October 2020, the founders of DiFy.Finance have not disclosed their identities, with a representative of the team claiming that the appropriate information will be published soon after launch. What Makes DiFy.Finance Unique? DiFy.Finance is part of the larger trend of decentralized finance: an industry that is focused on building decentralized financial instruments on top of existing smart-contract-enabled cryptocurrencies. These instruments include cryptocurrency lending, insurance, decentralized exchanges and other use cases. As of October 2020, it is a rapidly growing industry with over $10 billion in locked assets, up from just over $500 million in October 2019. YFIII specifically is an aggregator of cryptocurrency lending platforms, same as the platform it was forked from — yearn.finance. It allows users to deposit their cryptocurrency, which is converted into yTokens — on- blockchain  obligations that are secured by collateral in a different cryptocurrency. These tokens are then automatically parked in different DeFi lending services in order to maximize the lenders’ profit in the form of interest. YFIII’s unique advantage, and the reason for forking away from YFI, is to provide a more optimized crypto lending experience for mobile platforms.

How Many DiFy.Finance [YFIII] Coins Are There in Circulation? YFIII’s maximum supply is limited to 30,000 tokens, all of which are set to be openly distributed among the direct participants of the ecosystem with no pre-sale/ ICO  stage. According to the team behind the project, none of the YFIII tokens have been pre-allocated to the team members. How Is the DiFy.Finance Network Secured? YFIII, like the project it is based on — yearn.finance — is built on top of the  Ethereum  blockchain, meaning that its network is secured by the same hash function as ETH — Ethash. Ethash is a  proof-of-work  function that belongs to the Keccak family of hash functions. Where Can You Buy DiFy.Finance [YFIII]? As of October 2020, YFIII is available on three exchanges:     Decentralized exchange: Uniswap   Centralized exchanges: DigiFinex Bilaxy Here are some other articles that you may be interested in: What Is a Crypto Faucet?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is RAMP (RAMP)? RAMP  DeFi  is a decentralized protocol that intends to boost DeFi adoption by allowing non-Ethereum ( ETH ) users to stake tokens on ETH platforms; at the same time, Ethereum users can interact with the RAMP protocol and increase their yields.  RAMP DeFi allows the staked capital of non- ERC-20  staking blockchains to be collateralized into a stablecoin known as rUSD that is issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The main result of this is the maximization of capital efficiency on stacked digital assets, where users earn staking rewards, unlock liquidity from staked assets and stack multiple yield streams at the same time.  Users who are already on the Ethereum blockchain can mint eUSD by depositing their ERC20 stablecoins into RAMP’s eUSD liquidity pool. This means that rUSD and eUSD holders can exchange, lend or borrow both tokens freely and in turn create liquidity for users with capital locked into staking arrangements.  RAMP’s creation was prompted by the rapid growth of the staking economy, which has exceeded $300 billion by 2021, combined with the inefficiency of said economy’s markets. Who Are the Founders of RAMP? RAMP was co-founded by Lawrence Lim and Loh Zheng Rong. Before RAMP, Lim was the head of international growth at IOST and handled global sales at TradeGecko. He was also responsible for mergers and acquisitions at KPMG Corporate Finance LLC and asset management at JP Morgan Chase & Co. Lim studied at the Nanyang Technological University and got a bachelor of business degree in banking and finance with First Class Honors. Loh Zheng Rong co-founded NOX Pte Ltd and was a blockchain consulting partner at Merkle Ventures LLP. He was also the chief innovation officer at 2359 media, as well as the senior advisor of ICONIC Partners. He was also the chief operating officer and co-founder of Toucanapp Pte Ltd. He has a bachelor of business administration (B.B.A) degree in finance wealth management from the Singapore Management University. What Makes RAMP Unique? To efficiently power token exchanges between blockchain systems, the network takes advantage of liquidity on/off-ramp designs. Within this framework, the tokens that use a non-Ethereum standard are first converted into stablecoins called rUSD for use on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 -based stablecoins can also be converted into eUSD for use in Ramp DeFi’s liquidity pool. rUSD holders get the ability to use funds locked in non-Ethereum blockchains as well as the ability to use fully-collateralized stablecoins and earn staking incentives after the conversion. eUSD holders earn interest from lending their digital wealth as well as a chance to provide liquidity within DeFi protocols.

How Is the RAMP Network Secured? RAMP network collaborates with the Crust Network for secure on-chain decentralized data storage. As such, RAMP DeFi is an open finance project and has the potential to unlock liquidity from staked digital assets, allowing all users to collateralize their digital assets while locked in staking into liquid capital.  Crust implements the incentive layer protocol for decentralized storage. It is adaptable to multiple storage layer protocols, including IPFS, and even supports the application layer. The architecture it is based on has the capability to support a decentralized computing layer and build an entire cloud ecosystem. Where Can You Buy RAMP (RAMP)?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Bitcoin Gold (BTG)? Bitcoin Gold was founded in 2017 to become a user-friendly alternative to  Bitcoin . The BTG network aims to combine the security and sturdiness of the Bitcoin  blockchain  and its characteristics with the opportunity for experimentation and development.  BTG enhances and extends the crypto space with a blockchain closely compatible with Bitcoin but without using resources like Bitcoin hash power or vying for the \"real Bitcoin\" title. The company aims to present a coin with the implementation capabilities of Bitcoin, however, expanding on the opportunities for DeFi and DApp developers to use the coin.  Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin Gold? Bitcoin Gold was founded by a group of enthusiasts with diverse backgrounds and skills.  Hang Yin  is a co-founder and lead developer at Bitcoin Gold. He graduated with a degree in computer science from Fudan University in 2015. His professional career started right after he graduated. In late 2015, Yin became a software engineer for Google. After three years with the tech giant, Hang Yin decided to venture into entrepreneurship by starting Bitcoin Gold. In 2018, he also participated in the founding of HashForests.  Martin Kuvandzhiev  is the second co-founder of Bitcoin Gold, and he is also a board member at the company. He graduated with a degree in computer software engineering from the Technical University of Sofia, and his professional path started as a food service worker at McDonald’s. In 2015, he became an assistant professor at the Technical University of Sofia, and in 2016, he started a job as a lead iOS developer at phyre JSC. Since co-founding Bitcoin Gold in 2017, he has also launched another company called GoStartups.net. Currently, Kuvandzhiev is also the CEO of Assetify.  What Makes Bitcoin Gold Unique? Bitcoin Gold is a unique combination of the inherent properties of the original Bitcoin blockchain and an innovative approach to blockchain development and applications. As a hard fork of the original Bitcoin token, BTG aims to revolutionize the mining process by introducing a new proof-of-work algorithm that combats the scalability issues Bitcoin struggles with.  As an open-source protocol, Bitcoin Gold allows developers to participate in the governance and development of the blockchain freely. According to the company, this is a must-have requirement for pushing decentralization and one of the major points where Bitcoin struggles.  Bitcoin Gold is one of the first hard forks of the original cryptocurrency, which has attracted institutional and enterprise investors’ attention. BTG is available on a wide variety of exchanges, as well as swap services and wallets. Lastly, Bitcoin Gold has been actively adopted by several online browsers and service providers.

Another 15% were reserved for ecosystem support and development, and another 15% were distributed amongst the BTG community. About 20% of the total BTG token supply was reserved for yearly expenses. Close to 7% of BTG tokens were set aside for bounties and app collaboration, while another 5% went towards rewards for the founding team. The remaining 8% of tokens went towards covering pre-fork costs and community development. How Is the Bitcoin Gold Network Secured? As a Bitcoin hard fork, Bitcoin Gold relies on the proof-of-work ( PoW ) consensus mechanism. However, one of BTG’s main goals was to revolutionize the mining process by introducing the Equihash PoW, which favors  GPUs  for mining, unlike the Bitcoin blockchain.  While Bitcoin relies predominantly on application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) miners, This version of Equihash uses more memory than an ASIC can offer but runs fine on many graphics cards. Unlike the  Ethereum  blockchain, which relies on the proof-of-stake ( PoS ) mechanism and favors stakeholders, Bitcoin Gold places importance on the processing power miners have.

Venus is up 2.84% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #189, with a live market cap of $307,184,219 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 11,419,366 XVS coins   and a max. supply of 29,960,733 XVS coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Venus , the top exchanges for trading in  Venus  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   CoinTiger ,   KuCoin ,    and   ZT .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Venus (XVS)? Venus is an algorithmic money market and synthetic stablecoin protocol launched exclusively on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  The protocol introduces a simple-to-use crypto asset lending and borrowing solution to the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) ecosystem, enabling users to directly borrow against collateral at high speed while losing less to transaction fees. In addition, Venus allows users to mint VAI  stablecoins  on-demand within seconds by posting at least 200% collateral to the Venus smart contract.  VAI tokens are synthetic BEP-20 token assets that are pegged to the value of one U.S. dollar (USD), whereas XVS tokens are also BEP-20-based, but are instead used for governance of the Venus protocol, and can be used to vote on adjustments—including adding new collateral types, changing parameters and organizing product improvements.  The governance of the protocol is entirely controlled by XVS community members, since the Venus founders, team members and other advisors do have any XVS token allocations.  Who Are the Founders of Venus (XVS)? The development of the Venus project is being undertaken by the Swipe project team. The main goal of Venus is to achieve decentralization through community-governance. There are no pre-mines for the team, developers or founders, giving XVS holders total control over the path the Venus Protocol takes.  What Makes Venus (XVS) Unique? Venus’ main strength is its high speed and extremely low transaction costs, which are a direct result of being built on top of the Binance Smart Chain. The protocol is the first to enable users to access lending markets for  Bitcoin (BTC) ,  XRP  Litecoin ( LTC ) and other cryptocurrencies to source  liquidity  in real-time, thanks to its near-instant transactions.  Customers sourcing liquidity using the Venus Protocol do not have to pass a credit check and can quickly take out a loan by interacting with the Venus decentralized application ( DApp ). Since there are no centralized authorities in place, users are not restricted by their geographic region, credit score or anything else, and can always source liquidity by posting sufficient collateral.  These loans are provided from a pool contributed by Venus users, who receive a variable APY for their contribution. These loans are secured by the over-collateralized deposits made by borrowers on the platform.  To avoid market manipulation  attacks , the Venus Protocol utilizes price feed  oracles , including those from  Chainlink  to provide accurate pricing data that cannot be tampered with. Thanks to the Binance Smart Chain, the protocol can access the price feeds at a lower cost and with better efficiency, reducing the overall cost footprint of the system.

How Many Venus (XVS) Coins Are There in Circulation? Venus has a maximum total supply of 30 million XVS tokens, and just over 4.2 million XVS tokens were in circulation as of November 2020.  Venus was one of the first platforms to conduct a Launchpool on Binance, which allowed users to farm XVS by staking different assets including Binance Coin (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD) and Swipe (SXP) tokens. A total of 20% of the total supply (6 million XVS) was allocated to the Binance Launchpool, and the token was listed shortly after on the Binance spot exchange platform.  The project had no pre-sale or private sale, and the team has no token allocation, but 1% of the total supply (300,000 XVS) is reserved for Binance Smart Chain ecosystem grants. The remaining 23.7 million XVS tokens will be gradually unlocked over a period of four years as they are mined by those that use the Venus protocol.  According to the project  white paper , 35% of daily XVS rewards are distributed to borrowers, 35% to suppliers, and the remaining 30% to VAI stablecoin minters. How is the Venus (XVS) Network Secured? The Venus network is secured by the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain that runs in parallel to the Binance Chain. BSC is compatible with the  Ethereum  Virtual Machine (EVM) and is capable of running even if the Binance Chain goes offline or encounters issues.  Binance Smart Chain utilizes a unique  consensus algorithm  known as proof-of-staked authority (POSA) to secure the  blockchain . This is essentially a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines aspects of both  proof-of-stake  (POS) and proof-of-authority (POA). It is built around a network of 21 validators who are responsible for executing tasks on the Binance Smart Chain, and reaching consensus about recently processed transactions.  Beyond this, Venus suppliers are protected by automatic liquidation measures, which will automatically liquidate the collateral of borrowers if it falls below 75% of their borrowed amount—thereby reimbursing suppliers early to maintain the minimum collateralization ratio.  Where Can You Buy Venus (XVS)? As of November 2020, Venus is available to trade on a single exchange platform: Binance. It is listed against Tether (USDT),  Bitcoin (BTC) , Binance Coin (BNB) and Binance USD (BUSD). There are currently no direct fiat on-ramps to purchase Venus.

Alpha Finance Lab is a cross-chain  DeFi  platform that looks to bring alpha to users across a variety of different blockchains, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and  Ethereum .  The platform aims to produce an ecosystem of DeFi products that address unmet needs in the industry while remaining simple to use and access. The first product built by Alpha Finance Lab is Alpha Lending, a decentralized lending protocol with algorithmically-adjusted interest rates.  Leveraged yield-farming platform Alpha Homora was the second product launched by the platform, whereas AlphaX — a non-orderbook perpetual swap product — is scheduled to launch in 2021.  ALPHA is the native utility token of the platform. Token holders can earn a share of network fees by  staking  ALPHA tokens to cover any default loans. Other use cases for the token include  liquidity  mining and governance voting. Alpha Finance Lab will implement governance via a decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) allowing ALPHA holders to vote on the specifics of future Alpha products, and decide how they interoperate. This governance procedure is split over two levels: product-level governance and finance-level governance, giving token holders a great deal of control over the future of Alpha.  Who Are the Founders of Alpha Finance Lab? Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA) launched in 2020, following a public token sale on the Binance Launchpad.  The platform was founded by Tascha Punyaneramitdee, Alpha Finance Labs' project lead and a former head of strategy at Band Protocol. Prior to her position at Alpha Finance Lab, Punyaneramitdee gained extensive experience working with global financial firms — most recently working as an investment banking analyst at Jefferies from 2017-2018, and product manager at technology giant Tencent from 2018 to 2020.  In addition to Punyaneramitdee, the Alpha Finance Labs core team also includes lead engineer and blockchain researcher Nipun Pitimanaaree, a graduate in Mathematics and Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) four years in a row. In total, the Alpha Finance Labs team consists of at least seven members, according to its official  LinkedIn page .  What Makes Alpha Finance Lab Unique? Alpha Finance Lab looks to differentiate itself from other DeFi ecosystems by actively seeking, identifying and addressing unmet needs in the DeFi space with a breakneck development cycle.  Unlike other platforms, Alpha Finance Lab looks to ensure its solutions don’t just offer in-demand utility but are also user-friendly, helping to make DeFi more accessible. Each product developed by Alpha Finance Lab also acts to bolster the entire Alpha ecosystem, by providing additional utility for ALPHA token holders. Alpha Finance Lab’s first products each claim to bring an entirely new solution to the market. Alpha Homora is the first platform to introduce the leveraged yield farming concept and with the launch of Alpha Homora V2 in 2021, it will introduce the first smart contract that is capable of borrowing from another smart contract ( Cream Finance ) in an under-collateralized way. Moreover, once launched, AlphaX will become the first Uniswap/Sushiswap-style perpetual swap decentralized exchange without order books. This will allow more individuals to access the benefits of perpetual swaps (such as trading on leverage), without having to understand how they work in the background.

The current supply is about 453,509,553 LINK tokens, or about 45% of the total supply, as of end-September 2021. The Chainlink price at ICO was $0.11 and a total of 350 million LINK tokens were sold. This represents an over 200X from the ICO price to Chainlink price today. Chainlink price experienced a massive bull run in the period around mid-2019 to mid-2020. Chainlink bulls were colloquially referred to as “LINK Marines,'' becoming a well-known meme in the crypto community. Chainlink price reached an all-time high of $52.88 on May 9, 2021, on the back of an overall crypto market rally, as well as ongoing developments in the Chainlink ecosystem. According to the  ICO documentation , 35% of the total token supply will go towards node operators and the incentivization of the ecosystem. Another 35% of LINK tokens were distributed during public sale events. Lastly, the remaining 30% of the total token supply was directed towards the company for the continued development of the Chainlink ecosystem and network. How Is the Chainlink Network Secured? As an  Ethereum -based  ERC-20  token, Chainlink is secured by the proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism. Unlike the proof-of-work ( PoW ) consensus utilized by Bitocin, PoS relies on the amount of staked tokens for selecting node validators. PoS protocols were created with the idea to battle the vast power consumption required by PoW systems. PoS models are becoming increasingly popular as they need less electrical power and are easily scalable. While PoW has proven itself a reliable consensus mechanism, Ethereum and all other ERC-20 tokens have been growing rapidly and setting the trend in the space. Where Can You Buy Chainlink (LINK)? Chainlink and the LINK token are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market. Considering this, a lot of exchanges have pushed to start offering trades in LINK. One top exchange to  buy Chainlink  is Binance. Other exchanges offering trades in LINK include: Huobi Global Coinbase Pro Gate.io Kraken It is important to consider the fact that investing in cryptocurrency carries risk, just like any other investment.

Dash is up 4.69% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #72, with a live market cap of $2,114,807,723 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 10,413,133 DASH coins   and a max. supply of 18,900,000 DASH coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Dash , the top exchanges for trading in  Dash  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Dash (DASH)? Dash is an open-source  blockchain  and  cryptocurrency  focused on offering a fast, cheap global payments network that is decentralized in nature. According to the project's  white paper , Dash  seeks  to improve upon  Bitcoin  (BTC) by providing stronger privacy and faster transactions. Dash, whose name comes from \"digital cash,\" was  launched  in January 2014 as a fork of  Litecoin  (LTC). Since going live, Dash has grown to include features such as a two-tier network with incentivized nodes, including \"masternodes,\" and decentralized project governance; InstantSend, which allows for instantly settled payments; ChainLocks, which makes the Dash blockchain instantly immutable; and PrivateSend, which offers additional optional privacy for transactions. Who Are the Founders of Dash? Dash was founded by software developers Evan Duffield and Kyle Hagan. The project was originally called XCoin, changing its name to Darkcoin two weeks later before  rebranding  again to Dash in March 2015 in an effort to positively change its image. Before launching Dash, Duffield was a software developer with experience in finance, from his time working at Hawk Financial Group, as well as in public relations, having developed machine learning algorithms and search engines. He first  conceived of  Dash in 2012 as a way to add more anonymity to Bitcoin — hence, originally calling it Darkcoin. Duffield has  claimed  that he started it as a hobby, coding it in just one weekend. Duffield served as CEO of Dash Core Group — the company that supports the continued development, integrations and other activities of Dash — until December 2017 when he  stepped down  to focus on other strategic initiatives. Hagan  co-authored  the original Darkcoin whitepaper alongside Duffield. However, he  left  the project early on in December 2014. What Makes Dash Unique? According to its website, the  goal  of Dash is \"to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused cryptocurrency in the world.\" To accomplish this, the project relies on a network of masternodes, which are servers backed by collateral held in Dash that are designed to provide advanced services securely and governance over Dash's proposal system. In exchange for part of the block rewards, masternodes provide a second layer of services to the network. They facilitate functions such as InstantSend, PrivateSend and ChainLocks. Dash is marketed to both individual users and institutions, including merchants, financial services, traders and those who need to send international remittances. In October 2020, Dash Core Group  reported  that its strategic objectives moving forward include building its ecosystem and brand, ensuring that users are satisfied and further advancing the technology behind the network. Dash's governance system, or treasury, distributes 10% of the block rewards for the development of the project in a competitive and decentralized way. This has allowed the creation of many funded organizations, including Dash Core Group. In addition, the Dash Foundation, which advocates for the adoption of the cryptocurrency, receives donations and offers paid individual and institutional memberships.

Read an in-depth  crypto safety guide  on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource. Stay up to date on the latest cryptocurrency news with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many Dash (DASH) Coins Are There in Circulation? The maximum number of Dash tokens that can be issued is 18,921,005. However, this figure ultimately depends on how the governance decides to allocate the 10% of block rewards reserved for budget proposals. If none were ever allocated, only 17,742,696 DASH would ever be emitted. New Dash tokens are  created  through a  proof-of-work  mining algorithm in which the token emission rate is decreased by one-fourteenth, or approximately 7%, every 210,240 blocks, or about every 383 days. Approximately 45% of new DASH is awarded to miners, 45% to masternodes and 10% to fund future proposals. In August 2020, a proposal was  approved  that will, once in effect, change the ratio of coins awarded to miners and masternodes from 50/50 to 40/60, respectively. Within the first 48 hours of Dash's launch, approximately 2 million coins were mined, which significantly exceeded the planned emission schedule. Dash was originally forked from Litecoin, which suffered a similar issue at its launch due to a bug in its difficulty adjustment algorithm. While it is well-documented that Dash inherited the bug from Litecoin, there has, nonetheless, been widespread speculation about whether the resulting fastmine was intentional to benefit early miners. How Is the Dash Network Secured? Dash uses a two-tier network to secure its transactions. The first tier consists of nodes that carry out mining operations under a proof-of-work  consensus  protocol, meaning that they compete to solve complex cryptographic problems and at least 51% of nodes must approve a transaction for it to be added to the blockchain.  The PoW algorithm used by Dash is called \"X11\" — a custom hashing algorithm developed by Dash founder Duffield that uses a sequence of 11 hashing algorithms. According to Dash's  documentation , X11 is \"one of the safest and more sophisticated cryptographic hashes in use by modern cryptocurrencies.\" The second tier consists of masternodes operating under a proof-of-service consensus algorithm in which masternodes are rated based on their history of providing good services to the network. Masternodes oversee the network and have the power to reject new blocks added by nodes if they were approved improperly. They also enable Dash's ChainLocks feature, which increases security because every 12 hours, a rotating group of masternodes observe and confirm all new blocks added to the blockchain. Dash's developers have  stated  that this protects the network against  51% attacks . Where Can You Buy Dash (DASH)? As one of the more popular altcoins, Dash can be purchased on most major cryptocurrency exchanges, including  Binance ,  Coinbase Pro ,  Huobi Global ,  Kraken  and  OKEx . It can be traded against fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  and  Ether  (ETH), and  stablecoins  such as  Tether  (USDT) and  USD Coin  (USDC). It can be bought and sold on both spot and derivatives markets. Are you interested in buying Dash or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin ?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is USD Coin (USDC)?   USD Coin (known by its ticker USDC) is a stablecoin that is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis. Every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is backed up by $1 that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. The Centre consortium, which is behind this asset, says USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions. The stablecoin originally launched on a limited basis in September 2018. Put simply, USD Coin’s mantra is “digital money for the digital age” — and the stablecoin is designed for a world where cashless transactions are becoming more common. Several use cases have been unveiled for the USD Coin. As well as providing a safe haven for crypto traders in times of volatility, those behind the stablecoin say it can also allow businesses to accept payments in digital assets, and shake up an array of sectors including decentralized finance and gaming. Overall, the goal is to create an ecosystem where USDC is accepted by as many wallets, exchanges, service providers and dApps as possible. Who Are the Founders of USD Coin? The Centre Consortium has two founding members. One of them is the peer-to-peer payment services company Circle, while the other is the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. Other crypto ventures are open to join this consortium. Explaining the rationale behind USDC, Circle co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville wrote: “We believe that an open internet of value exchange can transform and integrate the world more deeply, eventually eliminating artificial economic borders and enabling a more efficient and inclusive global marketplace that connects every person on the planet.” In 2020, Circle and Coinbase collectively announced a major upgrade to USDC’s protocol and smart contract. The goal of these enhancements is to make it easier for USD Coin to be used for everyday payments, commerce and peer-to-peer transactions. What Makes USD Coin (USDC) Unique? The stablecoin market has become exceedingly crowded over recent years — but USD Coin has aimed to stand head and shoulders over competitors in several ways. One of them concerns transparency — and giving users the assurance that they will be able to withdraw 1 USDC and receive $1 in return without any issues. To this end, it says a major accounting firm is tasked with verifying the levels of cash that are held in reserve, and ensuring this matches up with the number of tokens in circulation. Unlike some crypto ventures, Circle and Coinbase have also achieved regulatory compliance — and this has helped pave the way for international expansion. Both projects are also well-funded, giving the stablecoin certainty. Related Pages : What is a stablecoin?

It’s a bit difficult to give an exact number here — as in theory, the number of USDC that can exist is limitless. New coins are created in line with demand, whenever someone wants to purchase one with their humble dollar. That said, there have been factors that have helped USD Coin enjoy an explosion in popularity over the years — especially in 2020. One of them is the sudden, sharp rise in the popularity of decentralized finance. USDC is a common sight on many  DeFi  protocols given how it serves as an onramp to the wider ecosystem. How Is the USD Coin Network Secured? All of the USDCs in circulation are actually ERC-20 tokens, which can be found on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the biggest advantages here is how it can then be integrated with Ethereum-based applications. As we mentioned earlier, security and confidence in this stablecoin is delivered by proving that U.S. dollars are being held safely in reserve. Where Can You Buy USD Coin (USDC)? As you might expect, one of the most enthusiastic exchanges that offers USDC is Coinbase, given how the exchange was involved in this stablecoin’s creation. USD Coin can also be purchased and traded on Poloniex, Binance, OKEx and Bitfinex, as well as decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. USDC is commonly bought with Bitcoin — and if it’s your first time buying Bitcoin, be sure to check out our comprehensive guide  here .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Ethereum (ETH)? Ethereum is a decentralized open-source  blockchain  system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other  cryptocurrencies , as well as for the execution of decentralized  smart contracts . Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the  Initial Coin Offering  (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the  return on investment  (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014. The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.” Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London”  hard fork . Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud. Who Are the Founders of Ethereum? Ethereum has a total of eight  co-founders  — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland. Russian-Canadian  Vitalik Buterin  is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website. British programmer  Gavin Wood  is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation. Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. -  Charles Hoskinson , who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. -  Joseph Lubin , a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development. What Makes Ethereum Unique? Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability. Ethereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes. In addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example,  USDT ,  LINK  and  BNB . Since the emergence of  Play2Earn  games, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the  ETH to PHP price . Ethereum London Hard Fork The Ethereum network has been plagued with high transaction fees, often buckling at seasons of high demand. In May 2021, the average transaction fee of the network peaked at  $71.72 . In addition to the high cost of transactions, the leading altcoin also suffers from scalability issues. As already mentioned, there are plans to transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm in order to boost the platform’s scalability and add a number of new features. The development team has already begun the transition process to ETH 2.0, implementing some upgrades along the way, including the London hard fork. The London upgrade went live in August 2021. It included five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), namely EIP-3529, EIP-3198, EIP-3541, and most notably EIP-1559 and EIP-3554. EIP-1559 is arguably the most popular upgrade out of all the EIPs. What Is EIP-1559? The EIP-1559 upgrade introduces a mechanism that changes the way gas fees are estimated on the Ethereum blockchain. Before the upgrade, users had to participate in an open auction for their transactions to be picked up by a miner. This process is known as a “first-price auction,” and as expected, the highest bidder wins.  With EIP-1559, this process is handled by an automated bidding system, and there is a set “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. This fee varies based on how congested the network is. Furthermore, users who wish to speed up their transactions can pay a “priority fee” to a miner for faster inclusion. EIP-1559 also introduces a fee-burning mechanism. A part of every transaction fee (the base fee) is burned and removed out of circulation. This is intended to lower the circulating supply of Ether and potentially increase the value of the token over time. Interestingly, less than two months after the London upgrade was implemented, the network had burned over $1 billion worth of Ether. Related Pages: New to crypto? Learn how to buy Bitcoin  today .

Read our educational section —  Alexandria . How Many Ethereum (ETH) Coins Are There In Circulation? In September 2021, there were around 117.5 million ETH coins in circulation, 72 million of which were issued in the genesis block — the first ever block on the Ethereum blockchain. Of these 72 million, 60 million were allocated to the initial contributors to the 2014 crowd sale that funded the project, and 12 million were given to the development fund. The remaining amount has been issued in the form of block rewards to the miners on the Ethereum network. The original reward in 2015 was 5 ETH per block, which later went down to 3 ETH in late 2017 and then to 2 ETH in early 2019. The average time it takes to mine an Ethereum block is around 13-15 seconds. In the August 2021 Ethereum network upgrade, the London hard fork contained the  Ethereum Improvement Protocol , EIP-1559. Instead of the first-price auction mechanism where the highest bidder wins, EIP-1559 introduces a “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. Users that want to have their transaction prioritized can pay a “tip” or “priority fee” to miners. As the base fee adjusts dynamically with transaction activity, this reduces the volatility of Ethereum gas fees, although it does not reduce the price, which is notoriously high during peak congestion on the network. One of the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s economics is that the latter is not deflationary, i.e. its total supply is not limited. Ethereum’s developers  justify  this by not wanting to have a “fixed security budget” for the network. Being able to adjust ETH’s issuance rate via  consensus  allows the network to maintain the minimum issuance needed for adequate security. With the introduction of EIP-1559 however, the base fees used in transactions are burned, removing the ETH from circulation. This means higher activity on the network would lead to more ETH burned, and the decreasing supply should lead to appreciation of Ethereum price, all things equal. This has the potential to make Ethereum deflationary, something ETH holders are excited about — a potential appreciation in Ethereum price today. How Is the Ethereum Network Secured? As of August 2020, Ethereum is secured via the Ethash proof-of-work algorithm, belonging to the Keccak family of hash functions. There are plans, however, to transition the network to a proof-of-stake algorithm tied to the major  Ethereum 2.0  update, which launched in late 2020. After the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) went live in the beginning of December 2020, it became possible to begin staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. An Ethereum stake is when you deposit ETH (32 ETH is required to activate validator software) on Ethereum 2.0 by sending it to a deposit contract, thus helping to secure the network by storing data, processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. At the time of writing in mid-September 2021, the Ethereum price now for 32 Ether is roughly $116,029. The amount of money earned by Ethereum validators right now is a return of 6% APR, which equates to around 1.91952 ETH, or $6960 in Ethereum price today. This number will change as the network develops and the amount of stakers (validators) increase. Ethereum staking rewards are determined by a distribution curve (the participation and average percent of stakers): some ETH 2.0 staking rewards were at 20% for early stakers, but will be lowered to end up between 7% and 4.5% annually.  The minimum requirements for an Ethereum stake are 32 ETH. If you decide to stake in Ethereum 2.0, it means that your Ethererum stake will be locked up on the network for months, if not years, in the future until the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is completed. Where Can You Buy Ethereum (ETH)? Given the fact that Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, it is possible to  buy Ethereum , or use ETH trading pairs on nearly all of the major crypto exchanges. Some of the largest markets include: Binance Coinbase Pro OKEx Kraken Huobi Global To check Ethereum price live in the fiat currency of your choice, you can use CoinMarketCap’s converter feature directly on the  Ethereum currency page .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What is the Oasis Network Designed for the next generation of blockchain, the Oasis Network is the first privacy-enabled blockchain platform for open finance and a responsible data economy. Combined with its high throughput and secure architecture, the Oasis Network is able to power private, scalable DeFi, revolutionizing Open Finance and expanding it beyond traders and early adopters to a mass market. Its unique privacy features can not only redefine DeFi, but also create a new type of digital asset called Tokenized Data that can enable users to take control of the data they generate and earn rewards for staking it with applications — creating the first-ever responsible data economy. Why the Oasis Network? \n Privacy-Enabled Blockchain: The Oasis Network claims to the world’s first scalable, privacy-enabled blockchain. ParaTimes on the Oasis Network can leverage confidential computing technology such as secure enclaves to keep data confidential — unlocking new use cases and applications for blockchain. Scalable, Private DeFi: The Oasis Network’s privacy-first design can expand DeFi beyond traders and early adopters — unlocking a new mainstream market. Plus its innovative scalability design brings fast speeds and high-throughput to DeFi transactions. Enables Data Tokenization: The Oasis Network can Tokenize Data, unlocking game-changing use cases for blockchain, and an ecosystem of apps and projects on the network — powering the next generation of privacy-first applications. Rapidly Growing Community: The Oasis Network has a thriving community of close to a thousand node operators, developers, enterprise partners, ambassadors, and nearly ten thousand community members engaged in global social channels. Top-Tier Team: The Oasis Team is made up of talent from around the world with backgrounds from Apple, Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, Harvard, and more — all committed to growing and expanding the impact of the Oasis Network. Technology Highlights \n Separates consensus and execution into two layers — the Consensus Layer and The ParaTime Layer — for better scalability and increased versatility. Separation of consensus and execution allows multiple ParaTimes to process transactions in parallel, meaning complex workloads processed on one ParaTime won’t slow down faster, simpler transactions on another. The ParaTime Layer is decentralized, allowing anyone to develop and build their own ParaTime. Each ParaTime can be developed in isolation to meet the needs of a specific application, such as confidential compute, open or closed committees, and more. The network’s sophisticated discrepancy detection makes Oasis more efficient than sharding and parachains — requiring a smaller replication factor for the same level of security. The network has broad support for confidential computing technology. The Oasis Eth/WASI Runtime is an open source example of a confidential ParaTime that uses secure enclaves to keep data private while being processed. Quick Token Facts Supply: The ROSE native token is a capped supply token. The circulating supply at launch will be approximately 1.5 billion tokens, and the total cap is fixed at 10 billion tokens. Token utility: The ROSE token will be used for transaction fees, staking, and delegation at the Consensus Layer. Staking rewards: ~2.3 billion tokens will be automatically paid out as staking rewards to stakers and delegators for securing the network over time.

Using Amp, networks like  Flexa  can quickly and irreversibly secure transactions for a wide variety of asset-related use cases. How does Amp work?  Amp claims to offer a straightforward but versatile interface for verifiable collateralization through a system of collateral partitions and collateral managers. Where collateral partitions can be designated to collateralize any account, application, or even transaction, and carry balances which are directly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, collateral managers are smart contracts that can lock, release, and redirect collateral in these partitions as needed in order to support value transfer activities. Amp supports a wide variety of use cases for collateralization, and also introduces the concept of predefined partition strategies, which can enable special capabilities such as collateral models through which tokens can be staked without ever leaving their original address.

Basis Cash is up 0.42% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #1606, with a live market cap of $2,178,772 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 54,589,186 BAC coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Basis Cash , the top exchanges for trading in  Basis Cash  are currently  Gate.io ,   Uniswap (V2) ,    and   Hotbit .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Basis Share (BAS)? Basis Share is one of three tokens that play a starring role in the Basis Cash ecosystem. It launched in late 2020 — and the team behind this project are aiming to create a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin that will become a mainstay in the  DeFi  space.  According to developers, BAS is “an ownership token which receives inflationary rewards from Basis Cash” — and its value will be directly linked to increasing adoption of BAC. Basis Shares and Basis Bonds are used to help keep Basis Cash at a price of $1. If the price falls below this level, bonds can be purchased at discount prices — and redeemed on a 1:1 basis once prices exceed this level. If BAC remains above $1 after bonds have been redeemed, new BAC tokens are minted and distributed to those who own Basis Shares. Who Are the Founders of Basis Share? This is where things get a little bit unusual. Basis Share, and the other tokens in the ecosystem, have been launched by two anonymous people called “Rick” and “Morty” — a clear reference to the popular cartoon series of the same name. During an AMA session in early January of 2021, “Morty” said that there are plans to expand the team further as there are technical positions to be filled concerning integrations and applications. What Makes Basis Share Unique? What’s unusual about Basis Share is how this token appears to have come from the ashes of a project that never saw the light of day. Elements of this ecosystem have been derived from Basecoin, which managed to raise $133 million in an ICO. Andreessen Horowitz was among just some of the big names that decided to get involved. Unfortunately, a clampdown by the SEC meant these funds needed to be returned to investors. Basis Share is unique because of how it is one of two tokens that will be responsible for ensuring that Basis Cash remains at a value of $1. This means that BAC isn’t actually collateralized by an asset such as gold, dollars or another cryptocurrency. One of the project’s main goals is to ensure that the Basis Cash stablecoin is fairly distributed, and that it is resistant to censorship. Related Pages: Find out more about  Basis Cash . How stable are algorithmic stablecoins? Learn about crypto in our  glossary . Subscribe to the  CoinMarketCap newsletter . How Many Basis Share (BAS) Coins Are There in Circulation? A total of one million BAS have been created, and they are being distributed to two liquidity pools on Uniswap in a 75/25 split. This token has been characterized as a “long position on the entire protocol” — a stark contrast to Basis Bonds, which have been likened to a fixed yield product. Of course, the number of BAC in circulation is likely going to be far more fluid, as this will be determined by overall levels of supply and demand. Where Can You Buy Basis Share (BAS)? There are a number of Basis Share markets that are currently available. A DAI/BAS trading pair has been launched on Uniswap, while BAS/USDT pairs can be found on MXC.COM, Hoo and BKEx. Uniswap is the most liquid market by some distance.  Learn more about how to convert fiat currencies into crypto here.

SYNC Network is up 5.05% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #1424, with a live market cap of $3,742,415 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 121,128,656 SYNC coins   and the max. supply is not available. What is the SYNC Network (SYNC)? \n The SYNC Network is a Layer 2 platform that creates cryptocurrency bonds that earn interest via Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The network uses ‘CryptoBonds,’ a new sort of financial primitive, to create digital interest earning assets with a twist — receiving principal amounts plus earned interest in a fully trade-able NFT that can be sold on secondary markets like OpenSea and Rarible any time. The goal of the SYNC Network is to bring stability and risk mitigation to DeFi by providing long-term staking, or ‘CryptoBonds’, to Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap. What are CryptoBonds? \n A CryptoBond is a fully tradeable ERC-721 NFT token that locks in liquidity on Uniswap. The SYNC platform mints two tokens: an ERC-20 awards token for Uniswap Liquidity Providers; and an ERC-721 NFT that bonds Uniswap liquidity pairs to SYNC tokens for a specified amount of time (ranging from 90 days to 3 years) that earns interest. When the CryptoBond matures, the holder receives back the original investment plus interest.  The CryptoBonds are made by bonding liquidity pair tokens with the corresponding dollar value of SYNC tokens at the current mining reward rate. Called ‘bonds’ because they are made by ‘bonding’ tokens representing the creators share of a liquidity pool (e.g., Uniswap ‘liquidity-tokens’) with an equally valued amount of SYNC tokens, until a specific period of time has lapsed (i.e., a CryptoBond reaches maturity). Some other unique features of CryptoBonds are individualized liquidity mining rewards that are readjusted daily based on liquidity pool supply and demand, and rare one-of-a-kind artwork that is created when the bonds are minted. How many tokens in circulation? \n While the total supply of SYNC is undefined, total supply can be seen any time by visiting  https://tokenomics.syncbond.com/total_supply . The total maximum supply of SYNC tokens is theoretically uncapped due to the inflationary and deflationary effects derived from market forces, i.e., when a bond is created, an equal value of tokens are burned from the total supply. Who Are the Founders of SYNC Network?  The SYNC Network was developed by a core group of agile developers, but the platform is community-governed and a fully decentralized DeFi ecosystem. The SYNC Network is governed by token holders who put forth proposals for a community vote, with CryptoBond holders having the most power (the more CryptoBonds you hold, the more voting power you have). However, any SYNC token holder can create a governance proposal to be voted on by the community. Where Can I Buy SYNC Network (SYNC)? \n The SYNC Network was originally developed to be used on Uniswap, and can be found here. However, the team is exploring other integrations for the future on other AMMs and DEXes. Here are some other articles that you may be interested in: What Is a Crypto Faucet?

Launched in 07/10/2019, Anchor Neural World headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, aims to develop a proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine with development teams in South Korea and Japan. Differentiated from existing AI systems via a unique data-driven approach, Anchor Neural World Foundation is developing the “ANW (Artificial Neural World)” engine—an advanced information retrieval inference engine. By developing an unparalleled information-based Artificial Intelligence solution, enabling it with a blockchain data layer and issuing its “ANW” token to support decentralized governance and utility within ANW’s global network, the ANW Foundation seeks to build a truly vibrant ecosystem. The ANW engine is the system’s core engine that is comprised of a proprietary inference engine and advanced neural network algorithm. The completed ANW engine will implement information retrieval and inference technology that resolves the issues of keyword breakdown and low relevance, which are the primary limitations of data augmentation. The ANW engine will enable AI-based learning management via natural language processing. It will make it possible to provide asset management services that entirely overcome psychological bias created due to information asymmetry and behavioral finance. The ANW Foundation is aspiring to use its ANW engine to expand into future high-tech industries to generate significant social benefits. To reach this end, the team is utilizing decentralized blockchain technology (ERC20 protocol) to secure relevant input and output data in a distributed ledger. Also, by providing an “application program interface (API)” for the ANW engine to third-party companies which can be utilized by ANW token holders, expansion across industries and viable applications for the ANW engine will be possible; exposing the ANW engine as data inference and AI as a Service (AIaaS) in a robust and open global ecosystem.

The remaining 97.000.000 ETZ are owned by the team and serve to ensure further development. In June 2018, the team decided to switch from PoW to PoS for security reasons. They decided on a new construction: MPoS, masternode proof-of-Stake. The MPoS consensus aims to combine the energy-saving process of Staking with the security and decentralization of masternodes in conjunction with autonomous self-government by the community.  The new network was launched in August 2018. It features 1-2 second block times and the Power and Slow-Nodes-Judge security management. Etherzero is reportedly fully compatible with Ethereum, allowing developers to publish their smart contracts on the Etherzero Blockchain free of charge.

Orchid’s four co-founders come from the blockchain and financial spheres. They are Dr. Steven Waterhouse as CEO, Jay Freeman, Brian J. Fox and Gustav Simonsson. Waterhouse is a well-known figure within cryptocurrency, having also co-founded venture capital outfit Pantera Capital, which is responsible for investing in some of the industry’s most popular companies. Freeman is the creator of Cydia, an alternative Apple App Store for jailbroken Apple devices and currently used by around 30 million jailbroken Apple products. Fox is responsible for the creation of United States bank Wells Fargo’s first interactive online banking system in the mid 1990s.  Simonsson, meanwhile, is one of the Ethereum network’s core security developers, helping with its original launch in 2015.  According to official literature, Waterhouse became alerted to the need for internet privacy improvements after becoming the victim of a  SIM-swap attack , and began researching VPN technology. What Makes Orchid Unique? The main idea behind Orchid is the use of blockchain technology to enhance the existing VPN experience.  Using cryptocurrency-based probabilistic nanopayments, users can benefit from anonymous VPN usage which does not rely on a centralized server and the risks associated with a particular country’s infrastructure. As a freely-exchangeable ERC-20 token, OXT also provides a trading incentive to own and increase network value for owners.  A separate feature allows users to purchase so-called “Orchid credits” with fiat currency. In this instance, OXT cannot be withdrawn and converted elsewhere, only spent with network providers. This is designed to appeal to those who do not wish to transact in cryptocurrency.  The appeal of Orchid, however, is not just among cryptocurrency users. Developers highlight a growing trend for internet freedom in the face of mounting geopolitical tensions and local restrictions.  Web 3.0 technology is used to provide some semblance of an open internet, as it was conceived when consumer access began to go mainstream in the early 1990s.

How Many Orchid (OXT) Coins Are There In Circulation? OXT has a supply of 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) units. There is no inflation, but the possibility for deflation is maintained by possible token burns of OXT as part of regular network function. Of the total supply, 51.13% are earmarked for network incentives (held in the Orchid Treasury) and other purposes. 17.3% went to investors as part of the seed Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), 4.49% for SAFT 2a and 3.38% in SAFT 2b. The remaining tokens will be distributed among four development teams. Multiple vesting schedules are in place, depending on the purpose and destination of the tokens. How Is the Orchid Network Secured? OXT is an ERC-20 standard token on Ethereum, and security risks revolve mainly around an attacker’s ability to harvest user data from Orchid itself. Given that very little information is contained in the platform’s smart contracts used for payments, the weak links in the chain mostly lie with the user. As developers note, involving third parties in token purchases to use Orchid — for example, major exchanges — could ultimately lead to an attacker learning a user’s identity by tracing transactions to their exchange wallet. Where Can You Buy Orchid (OXT)? OXT is freely tradeable on major exchanges such as Binance, Kraken and Coinbase Pro, with cryptocurrency, stablecoin and fiat pairs available.

I/O Coin is down 1.86% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #1555, with a live market cap of $2,583,721 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 19,202,520 IOC coins   and the max. supply is not available. Overview iOC (I/O coin) is currently in steadfast development, upgrading it's open source blockchain protocol to host a fully private cryptocurrency. Enabling fully confidential, decentralized peer to peer digital payments. iOC currently fuels Dapps (decentralized applications) that take advantage of a full array of features, from encrypted document storage, encrypted transfer, identity storage to a fully encrypted messaging system.  Profile  iOC was fair, launched on July 24th, 2014. iOC is a Privacy based cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem. iOC was initially launched via POW X11 algorithm. The difficult mining period lasted for 2 weeks. This was in order to properly and fairly distribute 16M coins before switching over to their own unique flavor of Proof of Stake Cipher. There are around 18 Million iOC in circulation with a maximum cap of 22 Million. The remaining iOC are minted via POS reward system for Stakers who work on confirming transactions. Stakers also receive transaction fees from on chain services. There is no governance model. The iOC community values freedom. The project was built with a free, fair minded and decentralized spirit. iOC was launched without any Initial Coin Offer (ICO) or Premine.  In 2015 iOC was the first project to move away from the Bitcoin QT wallet and replaced it with a unique \"fully decentralized\" HTML5/JS based UI wallet. Along with IONS DNS. In 2016 the iOC community and developers formed the I/O Digital foundation to further awareness of the open source public blockchain as it was done for Bitcoin, Litecoin and a few other fair launched projects. In 2017 I/O developers upgraded iOC's blockchain protocol to codename DIONS \"Decentralized Input Output Name Server\" further enhancing the base platform to host decentralized applications.  With the release of DIONS, the iOC Blockchain enabled identity storage. Users can store their own personal identification and be in full control of who can view it and who they want to share it with. It also allows storage of art and pictures including deeds, copyrights, trademarks, proof of ownership, data and much more. All of which are fully encrypted, fully controlled by the users private keys.  In addition the blockchain enabled features include, Private and Public identities, Stealth Addresses, AES 256 Encrypted 1MB Document/Data (upload, transfer via private users) capabilities, along with AES 256 Encrypted Instant Messaging. The I/O dev team also enabled and increased capacity to 4MB blocks with up to 16 second confirmation times. Along with our very own shuffle staking features. Ensuring that even low weighted users will always see a reward for their work.  In 2019, iOC's main focus continued a strong path towards privacy for all. Ensuring to serve as a privacy based economic and social platform. This by expanding their own privacy based mechanism in coding a Zero Knowledge protocol \"NightHawk\" ring signatures and Anon Balances.  NightHawk protocol is currently on stand-by as the team is embarking on developing Non Turing Complete smart contracts to be deployed in 2021. The team will follow with a project codenamed \"Chameleon - a scalable entropy based molecular graph ledger, to advanced interoperability of multiple blockchains and deploy our own scalable virtual machine and I/O abstract smart contract Ecosystem\". The team will follow Chameleon with DIOEX. Essentially creating a completely private, secure and fully decentralized economic ecosystem. iOC is a fully decentralized world wide cryptocurrency maintained by the I/O Digital Foundation and the iOC World Wide Community.

Steem is down 1.35% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #286, with a live market cap of $243,536,454 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 392,124,018 STEEM coins   and the max. supply is not available.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Steem (STEEM)? Steem is a community-focused  blockchain  that creates an instant earning opportunity for the network’s users. The protocol is designed to provide an earning opportunity for customers based on their value to the network. It is designed to provide users with a platform where they can post curated content online, and get paid in cryptocurrency. The protocol is a publicly available, incentivized blockchain database that allows users to interact with themselves and earn in return. It leverages technologies from both social media and cryptocurrency to provide users with value. The network ensures the fair treatment of contributors by running a reward structure that reflects each user’s contribution. Steemit  is the first app that was built on the Steem blockchain, and it launched on July 4, 2016. The protocol aims to provide value for its community of users in the following ways: To provide thoughtfully chosen news and commentaries. Creating an opportunity to earn. As a source that offers answers to users’ inquiries. Offering a stable cryptocurrency pegged to the USD. Who Are the Founders of Steem? Ned Scott, together with a blockchain developer Dan Larimer, launched the first app on Steem blockchain in January, called Steemit. The app is similar to other social network apps except that it is based on blockchain technology, hence making it a decentralized and non-custodial app. The network is without the common data-related problems faced by traditional social platforms.  Ned Scott  worked as a business operation and financial analyst at an American Food importing company, Gellert Global Group, from 2012 to 2015. He met Dan, his partner, in 2015 where he found out they shared similar interests. Dan Larimer  is a software engineer and serial entrepreneur who is captivated by blockchain technology, DEXs, cryptocurrency and other technologies. Dan co-founded Steem alongside Ned Scott and was the CTO until he left the company in 2017. What Makes Steem Unique?  Many traditional social media companies have made lots of money through the content produced by their users. However, what sets Steem apart is the support it offers to its users by rewarding them for their valuable input to the platform.  One unique feature of  the network  is that it is based on blockchain technology —making it the first of its kind. As a result, it is non-custodial and decentralized, with no downtime or data abuse, and the platform’s data are perfectly secured too. Also, users are paid in cryptocurrencies for participating on the platform. Steem is guided by one key principle: that those who contribute to a venture should be paid by the owners, just like startups do by allocating shares during funding rounds. Another core belief is to serve its community members by rendering various financial services and opportunities.  How Many Steem (STEEM) Coins Are There in Circulation? Token Economics Unlike other blockchains where new coins are created through mining, Steem distributes the bulk of its coins (STEEM) to the rewards pool. STEEM is the primary coin of the protocol. The pool distributes tokens to users on the platform based on their input. Witnesses (block-creating accounts) add new blocks to the Steem blockchain every three seconds. Therefore, STEEM is produced by the network daily and the new coins are distributed in this manner: Content curators and authors receive 75% of the new coins created. Users with Steem Power holdings (another Steem cryptocurrency) are allocated 15% of the coins. The remaining 10% is awarded to witnesses. The other two cryptocurrencies apart from STEEM are the  Steem Dollars (SBD)  and Steem Power (SP). How Is The Steem Network Secured? After the company was bought by Justin Sun, founder of Tron platform, there was a restructuring of Steem’s operations. Therefore, new blocks are no longer created through mining and the network does not use proof-of-work. The protocol does not rely on  proof-of-work  to create new blocks but schedules witnesses to create a block every three seconds. However, the Steem blockchain uses delegated proof-of-stake to increase transaction speed on the platform and make it more scalable. Witnesses are rewarded with Steem Power for every block created. Where Can You Buy Steem (STEEM)? There are several cryptocurrency exchanges where users can purchase Steem tokens, SteemPower, or Steem Dollars (SBD), or even concert them to local currencies. A user without an account can buy through crypto exchanges, for instance,  Binance . In addition, STEEM and Steem Dollars can easily be traded for bitcoin, which can then be converted to fiat currencies.  Click here  to get more information about crypto on the CMC blog.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Ontology ($ONT)? Ontology is a high performance, open source blockchain specializing in  digital identity and data . Ontology's unique infrastructure supports robust cross-chain collaboration and Layer 2 scalability, offering businesses the flexibility to design a blockchain that suits their needs. With a suite of decentralized identity and data sharing protocols to enhance speed, security, and trust, Ontology’s features include ONT ID, a mobile digital ID application and DID used throughout the ecosystem, and DDXF, a decentralized data exchange, and collaboration framework At its launch, Ontology chose to forego the popular  initial coin offering (ICO)  model in favor of a series of community distributions and airdrops of its ONT  cryptocurrency , which began life as a NEP-5 token on the  NEO  blockchain.  This helped to quickly establish both organic price discovery and a passionate community and helped the project to avoid subsequent regulatory scrutiny. For example, for a brief period any person who signed up for the Ontology newsletter received an airdrop of free 1,000 ONT, which reached a value of $10 per token soon after the token became listed on major exchanges like  Binance .  Ontology  launched its own MainNet  on June 30, 2018 and now operates independently from the NEO blockchain.  Who Are the Founders of Ontology? Ontology was established by Li Jun, Founder of Ontology. During Ontology’s early stages of development, Ontology received technical support from some members of Onchain’s developer team. However, the two have always been officially separate projects pursuing their own goals.  What Makes Ontology Unique? Ontology offers a variety of real-life use cases and allows businesses to build their own blockchain on top of the Ontology blockchain.  Importantly, Ontology offers more flexibility for enterprises, allowing them to create customized blockchains to fit their specific needs in terms of features like governance and enhanced privacy, functionality that competitors like  Ethereum  and NEO lack by design. The ONT chain also helps negate  transaction network fees  by generating and distributing free  Ontology Gas (ONG)  to ONT holders based on their holdings.  Ontology further provides additional features such as smart contracts, cryptographic identity proofs (ONT ID) and tokenized data (DDXF) that can seamlessly be transferred between different blockchains.  Example: A patient's medical records, subject to strict data privacy laws in most countries, may be utilized across the Ontology network without compromising the integrity and privacy of the patient's data. The medical business that is transferring the confidential data is able to control what is shared with other parties and under which conditions, with no fear of patient data falling into the hands of unauthorized parties.

How Many Ontology (ONT) Coins Are There in Circulation? Ontology has a total coin supply of 1,000,000,000 ONT, of which nearly 80% are currently in circulation.  At its launch, 15% of ONT tokens were allocated to its core team, 10% to the NEO council, 28% to institutional partners, 10% to its technical community and 25% to the development of its ecosystem. These tokens were subject to a strict screening process and various unlocking periods that ran over two years until the end of October 2020. Read more about its  token distribution here .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Presearch . What Is Presearch (PRE)? Presearch  is a decentralized search engine with more than 1.5 million users and over 10 million searches a month. It offers users three unique value propositions: Having control over their data and privacy Being paid for contributing value to the ecosystem A decentralization of the search ecosystem Presearch identified the problem of traditional search engines and turned it on its head. Instead of search engines monetizing the user’s data, the users monetize the data themselves. Presearch does this by paying its users to utilize its search engine. The company is designed to be a non-profit organization, thereby eliminating incentives of for-profit corporations that may run contrary to users’ best interests. It also achieves decentralization of its ecosystem thanks to the operation of its nodes by community members.  Presearch has an incredibly detailed roadmap that splits its evolution into three main phases. The first phase followed its launch in 2017 and was designed to establish a product-market fit. The second phase, which the company currently finds itself in, is dedicated to building a sustainable business model aimed at decentralizing search. The final phase will be dedicated to decentralizing governance through the establishment of a  DAO . At the moment, Presearch is working on its mainnet launch and was listed by Google as a default search engine option on all new Android devices across the U.K. and Europe.  Who Are the Founders of Presearch? Presearch was launched by CEO Colin Pape and Thomas LeClair. Prior to founding Presearch in 2017, they had founded Shopcity.com, a turn-key shop local platform. They are complemented by CTO Trey Grainger, an experienced engineer and data scientist that joined the project’s advisory board in 2017. Tim Enneking is the chairman of Presearch’s advisory board and founder of the world’s first crypto fund.  What Makes Presearch Unique? Presearch offers several products with real-world utility. Its search tool allows users to search the internet in the same way they are used to with search engines like Google or DuckDuckGo. Users can choose between searching on the default Presearch engine or switching to results from more than 100 different providers. Presearch also offers search rewards to its users, paying them up to 8 PRE per day at a rate of 0.1 PRE per search. For advertisers, Presearch developed a Keyword Staking mechanism. Token holders can stake their PRE against specific words or search terms to display ads to users. If a user searches for a term, the Presearch algorithm shows the ad with the most PRE staked belonging to this term. If there are no matches for a long-tail keyword, it breaks down the term into individual words and picks the ad with the most PRE staked on a single word from the search query. Furthermore, Presearch offers a marketplace where PRE tokens can be bought and mobile apps that users can choose over traditional search engines. Presearch also provides a browser extension that enables users to search from their address bar in their web browser and use Presearch as the default search engine.

Read our  deep dive about Presearch and its price prediction. Get the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Presearch (PRE) Coins Are There in Circulation? The total supply of PRE is 500 million after half of the initial supply was burned to make the project leaner. The token distribution is as follows: Current External Wallets - 140M Staked - 47.9M Portal (Crowd sale wallet) - 97.2M Savings (Presearch Marketplace wallet) - 36.5M Earned Rewards - 60.5M Reward Reserve - 30M Sales Reserve - 37M Project Team - 50M PRE has several use cases in the Presearch ecosystem: users receive PRE as a reward for searches, use it to make purchases in the store, and can stake it to display ads on the platform. In the future, they will also be able to stake it against ads they find undesirable, raising the cost of displaying such ads. Node operators stake PRE to secure the network, while partners can pay and stake PRE to be added as a search provider. Currently, revenue on the platform is distributed in the following manner: 20% node rewards 20% operations 30% token repurchases 5% platform improvement rewards 5% data partner rewards 5% development grants 15% search rewards How Is the Presearch Network Secured? PRE is an  ERC-20  token on Ethereum. ERC-20 is a token standard most new tokens follow when publishing on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchains and the go-to solution for many decentralized applications and exchanges to launch on. It is secured by a  proof-of-work  consensus mechanism that requires miners to mine new Ether. A set of decentralized nodes validates transactions and secures the Ethereum blockchain. The platform is secured by nodes, which connect to a Node Gatewaythat receives requests from the server and removes personally identifiable information from the search requests. A node registry manages the identity of all nodes, the node stats and payouts. Nodes are compensated in PRE for different types of services: 1) Registering (all nodes). Registering with a Node Gateway, which can then route queries to the node if it passes health and security validation. 2) Validating (all nodes). Coordinating with a Node Validator to ensure that each node is only running trusted Presearch software (to avoid security issues from potential bad actors). 3) Coordinating. Processing and distributing queries sent by Node Gateways. This may require routing to multiple serving nodes and aggregating the results. 4) Federating. Proxying other data sources and returning their data as part of search results. 5) Serving. Hosting portions of the search index used to process queries. 6) Crawling. Crawling websites to build out search indices. 7) Indexing. Writing federated or crawled data to search indexes to be served by serving nodes. Where Can You Buy Presearch (PRE)? PRE is available on  KuCoin ,  HitBTC ,  CoinEx ,  ProBit Global  and  1inch Exchange . Our most recent articles about  Presearch : What Is Presearch (PRE)?

  "content": "EOS Price Live Data The live  EOS price today  is $4.77 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $983,047,110 USD.   We update our EOS to USD price in real-time.   EOS is up 1.10% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #43, with a live market cap of $4,586,288,108 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 962,329,836 EOS coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  EOS , the top exchanges for trading in  EOS  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is EOS? EOS is a platform that’s designed to allow developers to build decentralized apps (otherwise known as  DApps  for short.) The project’s goal is relatively simple: to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace blockchain technology — and ensure that the network is easier to use than rivals. As a result, tools and a range of educational resources are provided to support developers who want to build functional apps quickly. Other priorities include delivering greater levels of scalability than other blockchains, some of which can only handle less than a dozen transactions per second. EOS also aims to improve the experience for users and businesses. While the project tries to deliver greater security and less friction for consumers, it also vies to unlock flexibility and compliance for enterprises. The blockchain launched back in June 2018. Who Are the Founders of EOS? The EOS platform was developed by the company Block.one, and its white paper was authored by Daniel Larimer and Brendan Blumer. Both men continue to be members of Block.one’s executive team, with Blumer serving as CEO and Daniel Larimer as CTO. Blumer is a serial entrepreneur, and one of his earliest ventures involved selling virtual assets for video games. He went on to co-found Okay.com, a digitally focused real estate agency in Hong Kong. Larimer is a software programmer who has also started a series of crypto ventures. They include the crypto trading platform BitShares and the Steem blockchain. The pair met in 2016 and formed Block.one the following year. What Makes EOS Unique? To an extent, you could argue that EOS aims to create familiarity for its users. Whereas EOS.IO is probably best compared to an operating system like Windows or iOS, EOS is the cryptocurrency that drives the network. According to the company, it has the capacity to accommodate the demands of hundreds, if not thousands, of DApps — even if they were being used by substantial numbers of people. Parallel execution, as well as a modular approach, are said to drive this efficiency. In a unique twist, token holders have the ability to vote for block producers — as well as other matters such as protocol upgrades. Unfortunately, some of the most distinguishing features of EOS are those that certain critics dislike the least. There are those that argue that extensive Block.one’s involvement with this project means it’s rather centralized — and some argue this is the opposite of what blockchains and cryptocurrencies were meant to achieve. Related Pages: Basics, how-to guides and deep dives: Learn about crypto with CMC Alexandria Find out the meaning of crypto and blockchain terms in our glossary What is Steem? CoinMarketCap Blog: In-depth news, features and analysis How Many EOS Coins Are There in Circulation? There are 936 million EOS coins in circulation at the time of writing, and a total supply of 1.02 billion tokens. Block.one held an initial coin offering for EOS back in June 2017 and it lasted for a year — that’s substantially longer than many of the ICOs seen at the time. A total of $4.02 billion was raised in the process, and investors from the U.S. were unable to take part. Looking at the breakdown of how tokens were distributed, 10% were allocated to the founders, while 90% were distributed among investors.  It is worth noting that Block.one won’t receive this allocation straightaway — instead, it’ll happen over a 10-year period. How Is the EOS Network Secured? EOS uses a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This concept was conceived by Larimer, and aims to solve some of the flaws that are seen in PoW and PoS systems. As we briefly explained earlier, those who own EOS tokens are able to vote for representatives who will be responsible for validating transactions. One of the advantages is that this helps eliminate consolidation, where smaller miners are pushed out by those who have greater levels of computing power and resources. Where Can You Buy EOS? It is possible to  buy EOS  through Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and countless other exchanges. Given how widely used it is in the crypto industry, you’ll probably be hard pressed to find a trading platform that doesn’t support it. Some services will allow you to use fiat currencies to make a purchase, either through a bank transfer or a credit card.  Find out more about fiat on-ramps here.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Hedera (HBAR)? Hedera is the most used, sustainable, enterprise-grade public network for the decentralized economy that allows individuals and businesses to create powerful decentralized applications ( DApps ). It is designed to be a fairer, more efficient system that eliminates some of the limitations that older blockchain-based platforms face — such as slow performance and instability. It was funded through an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2018 and first launched open access to its mainnet just over a year later in September 2019. As part of the ICO, investors were able to purchase the platform’s native utility token (HBAR) at the lowest possible pricing.  The HBAR token has a dual role within the Hedera public network.  First and foremost, HBAR the fuel that powers Hedera services, such as  smart contracts , file storage and regular transactions. Second, it's used to help secure the network, since HBAR users can  stake  their tokens to assist with maintaining the integrity of the platform.  Who Are the Founders of Hedera Hashgraph? Hedera Hashgraph has two founders: Dr. Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon. Dr. Leemon Baird is credited as the investor of the hashgraph distributed consensus algorithm and currently works as Hedera's chief scientist.  Prior to founding Hedera Hashgraph, Baird accumulated more than a decade of experience in various computer science and security roles and previously worked as a senior research scientist at the Academy Center by Cyberspace Research. He also holds the position of co-founder and CTO at Swirlds Inc., a platform for building DApps. On the other hand, Mance Harmon is Hedera’s CEO and an experienced technology executive and seasoned entrepreneur. Harmon has around two decades of experience holding executive roles at prominent firms — many of which are in the IT security industry. Like Dr. Leemon Baird, Mance Harmon also holds a second position at Swirlds Inc., as its co-founder and CEO.  In addition to the founders, the Hedera leadership team also comprises more than a dozen individuals, many of which have had distinguished careers. What Makes Hedera Hashgraph Unique? Unlike most other cryptocurrency platforms, Hedera Hashgraph isn’t built on top of a conventional  blockchain . Instead, it introduces a completely novel type of distributed ledger technology known as a Hashgraph.  This technology allows it to improve upon many blockchain-based alternatives in several key areas, including speed, cost, and scalability. Hedera transactions have an average transaction fee of just $0.0001 USD and typically reach finality in under five seconds. Overall, Hedera Hashgraph claims it can handle more than 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) — compared to the around 5-20 for most popular proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchains. The platform offers several major network services. These include: A token service that allows users to easily configure and mint both fungible and non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) on Hedera with just a few lines of code. A  consensus  service that acts as a layer of trust for any application or network that needs a secure, verifiable log of events. Smart contract tools that let developers build powerful and efficient decentralized applications. Decentralized file storage services with features include proof-of-deletion, controlled mutability, and time-based file expiry.

The Hedera Hashgraph token, HBAR, has a maximum total supply of 50 billion units. Out of this, almost seven billion were in circulation as of January 2021 — equivalent to around 14% of the total supply. Hedera publishes regular reports detailing when the next wave of HBAR tokens will be unlocked. These reports can be viewed  here .  According to  Hedera's resources , the two project founders each have a coin grant of two billion HBARs, equivalent to 4% of the total supply each. These tokens are vested over a six-year period.  Other senior executives at Hedera (that joined prior to 2018) have coin grants of between 250 million and 300 million coins. These tokens are vested over a period that ends in December 2021.  According to Hedera's  Economics Whitepaper  (published June 2020), around 17.03 billion HBAR is estimated to be in circulation by 2025 — equivalent to 34% of the total supply. How Is the Hedera Hashgraph Network Secured? Hedera Hashgraph uses a novel consensus system known as Hashgraph consensus to keep its network secure.  This uses a rotating governing council consisting of up to 39 highly diversified organizations that span across up to 11 different industries. These are involved with directing the Hedera codebase, voting on platform decisions and operating the initial nodes on the Hedera public network. Hedera uses a novel form of  proof-of-stake  (PoS) which allows HBAR users to stake their resources to help protect the network. Right now, all Hedera nodes are managed by either Hedera itself or the governing council members, but there are plans to switch to a permissionless system in the future.  \\\nOverall, Hedera's security setup ensures it achieves \"asynchronous”  Byzantine fault tolerance  (ABFT) — meaning it can guarantee both the timing and order of a set of transactions, even if some data is delayed or lost. Where Can You Buy Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)? HBAR is a popular digital asset that is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including  Binance , Bittrex and  Huobi Global .  Some of the more popular HBAR trading pairs include HBAR/USDT, HBAR/BTC and HBAR/ETH, and there are also several fiat trading options for the cryptocurrency, including HBAR/USD, HBAR/KRW and HBAR/INR.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What is Unilend? UniLend is a permission-less DeFi protocol that combines spot trading services and lending/borrowing functionality within the same platform. Whereas other DeFi protocols support only ~30 assets, anyone can list any ERC20 asset on UniLend for decentralized trading and lending/borrowing.  UniLend’s mission is to open the DeFi space up to the $29B of ERC20 tokens which are currently excluded from DeFi, hence their motto ‘unlocking the true potential of decentralised finance’. How is UniLend different to other DeFi protocols? Existing DeFi solutions have left the majority of digital assets outside of the DeFi ecosystem. There are over 6000 tokens listed on coinmarketcap. However, other DeFi protocols support less than 30 assets. Some protocols offer lending and borrowing with a limited set of tokens while others offer the freedom to trade any ERC20 assets but neglect the lending and borrowing aspect. UniLend is bridging that gap by combining the decentralization aspect of enabling any ERC20 to be utilized as collateral for lending & borrowing whilst providing the flexibility for users to also trade their assets in-platform. Ultimately, UniLend aims to unlock the full potential of digital assets for their owners. What is the purpose of UniLend's native UFT token? UFT token is primarily used to facilitate governance of the UniLend protocol. A number of factors relating to the proper functioning of the protocol, will be decided by UFT holders via proposals which require majority consensus to be implemented. Liquidity providers are a key component in ensuring the sustainability of a decentralized finance protocol by facilitating liquidity within the protocol. They will therefore be rewarded with UFT tokens via liquidity mining, in addition to a percentage of trading and borrowing fees. Platform users who use UniLend for lending, borrowing or trading will be rewarded with governance power in the form of UFT tokens to encourage not only use of the platform’s services, but also to facilitate distributed governance.

Bitcoin SV is up 1.92% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #55, with a live market cap of $3,215,677,265 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 18,886,933 BSV coins   and a max. supply of 21,000,000 BSV coins.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Bitcoin SV (BSV)? Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged following a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain in 2018, which had in turn forked from the BTC blockchain a year earlier. The goal of Bitcoin SV is to fulfill the original vision of the Bitcoin protocol and design as described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, early Bitcoin client software and known Satoshi writings. BSV aims to offer scalability and stability in line with the original description of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as well as deliver a distributed data network that can support enterprise-level advanced blockchain applications. To this end, it has removed artificial block size limits and re-enabled Script commands and other technical capabilities which had been historically disabled or restricted by the protocol developers of the BTC blockchain. This allows the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining extremely low transaction fees for micropayments, in addition to offering advanced capabilities such as tokens, smart contracts, computation and other data use cases. The BSV network is unique in its capacity for unbounded on-chain scaling while also being more aligned with the original design of Bitcoin than any other blockchain. Who are the founders of Bitcoin SV (BSV)? Blockchain technology company nChain developed the BSV node software and has regularly delivered protocol updates that restore the functionality of the original Bitcoin protocol. nChain now provides the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team which continues to advance the node software and other infrastruture tools for the BSV network. nChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright, who has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, has been a supporter of BSV since the split between BCH and BSV in 2018, following the proposal of controversial protocol changes by several BCH developers. Entrepreneur Calvin Ayre is also a vocal advocate for BSV and regularly seeks investment opportunities in companies and projects building on the blockchain. After BSV split from BCH, a Switzerland-based non-profit industry association known as Bitcoin Association was formed that now supports the global growth and adoption of the BSV blockchain and digital currency. Work of the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team at nChain is performed at the request and direction of Bitcoin Association. What makes Bitcoin SV (BSV) unique? BSV differs from other versions of Bitcoin in its adherence to the original Bitcoin protocol and focus on realising the vision for the Bitcoin network outlined in the Bitcoin white paper and other known Satoshi Nakamoto writings. Unlike BTC, which now primarily functions as an investment or store of value asset, BSV aims to offer a scalable and usable blockchain platform for efficient payments and distributed data applications for consumer, enterprise and government users. Thanks to its unbounded block size, BSV can scale to meet market forces and accommodate the demands of any application and payment network without resorting to second-layer solutions. In 2021, the BSV network mined the world’s first gigabyte (1000+ megabytes) level blocks – reaching up to 2 GBs in August 2021; for comparison, 2 GBs is 2000 times the 1MB block cap of the BTC network. Block capacity of the BSV network is expected to continue growing further to support more transaction volume and data use caes. With testing of the new node software, the BSV Infrastructure Team has already demonstrated the BSV network’s ability to handle up to 100,000 transactions per second and expects that capacity to be shown on the BSV mainnet and grow even higher in the future. With this capability, BSV rivals and aims to supersede the payment processing capabilities of platforms like VISA at a fraction of the cost to users. BSV also offers a scalable and product-ready platform for blockchain application developers, many of whom have migrated from other networks such as Ethereum after encountering scaling issues as their adoption increased. BSV is capable of scaling along with user adoption, which means developers can be assured that transaction fees will remain low and interactions will be processed quickly. The functionality of BSV is attractive to enterprise and government users, with the blockchain offering an efficient and stable platform for companies and agencies looking to experiment or build with blockchain technology.  How many Bitcoin SV (BSV) coins are there in circulation? As defined by the original Bitcoin protocol, there will be a maximum of 21 million BSV coins in circulation. Fresh coins from this circulation are distributed to BSV miners via block rewards, which they earn in addition to transaction fees for validating blocks. Block rewards for miners are cut by 50% at predefined periods to slowly shift the reliance of miners on these subsidies to transaction fees and to reduce the flow of new tokens as they approach their maximum quantity. How Is the Bitcoin SV network secured? BSV is secured by the proof-of-work consensus mechanism as described in the Bitcoin white paper. This means that for a block containing new transactions to be added to the blockchain, miners must solve a complex mathematical problem using their computer’s processing power. The miner who solves this problem first earns the block reward and transaction fees, and their block is added to the chain. As more blocks are built on top of their block, the validity of the transactions now stored on the chain are ratified by other nodes and become very difficult, if not virtually impossible, to alter. Where can you buy Bitcoin SV (BSV)? Bitcoin SV is listed on major exchanges including OKEx, KuCoin, Huobi, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bithumb — as well as dozens of additional platforms.

It has a circulating supply of 6,018,895 COMP coins   and a max. supply of 10,000,000 COMP coins.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Compound (COMP)? Compound is a  DeFi  lending protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies by depositing them into one of several pools supported by the platform.  To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Compound . When a user deposits tokens to a Compound pool, they receive cTokens in return. These cTokens represent the individual’s stake in the pool and can be used to redeem the underlying cryptocurrency initially deposited into the pool at any time. For example, by depositing ETH into a pool, you will receive cETH in return. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens to the underlying asset increases, which means you can redeem them for more of the underlying asset than you initially put in — this is how the interest is distributed.  On the flip side, borrowers can take a secured loan from any Compound pool by depositing collateral. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio varies based on the collateral asset, but currently ranges from 50 to 75%. The interest rate paid varies by borrowed asset and borrowers can face automatic liquidation if their collateral falls below a specific maintenance threshold. Since the launch of the Compound mainnet in September 2018, the platform has skyrocketed in popularity, and recently passed more than $800 million in total locked value.  Who Are the Founders of Compound? Compound was founded in 2017 by Robert Leshner and Geoffrey Hayes, both of whom previously worked in high-profile roles at Postmates — an online food delivery service. The two continue to hold executive positions at Compound Labs, Inc — the software development firm behind the Compound protocol, with Leshner currently serving as CEO, while Hayes is the CTO. Though both founders have experience founding successful companies, Robert Leshner, in particular, has been particularly active in helping to grow the  blockchain  space, and has publicly invested in popular crypto platforms including Argent Wallet, Opyn, and Blockfolio.  The Compound team now comprises over a dozen individuals — almost half of which work as engineers. What Makes Compound Unique? According to Compound, the majority of cryptocurrencies sit idle on exchange platforms, doing nothing for their holders. Compound looks to change this with its open lending platform, which allows anybody who deposits supported Ethereum tokens to easily earn interest on their balance or take out a secured loan — all in a completely trustless way.  Compound’s community governance sets it apart from other similar protocols. Holders of the platform’s native governance token — COMP — can propose changes to the protocol, debate and vote whether to implement changes suggested by others — without any involvement from the Compound team. This can include choosing which cryptocurrencies to add support for, adjusting collateralization factors, and making changes to how COMP tokens are distributed. These COMP tokens can be bought from third-party exchanges or can be earned by interacting with the Compound protocol, such as by depositing assets or taking out a loan.

Check out  CMC Alexandria. Read our  blog  to stay up to date with the latest industry news and events. How Many Compound (COMP) Coins Are There in Circulation? Like many digital assets, only a fixed number of COMP tokens will ever come into existence. The total supply is capped at 10 million COMP and as of writing, less than a third are in circulation (~3.3 million).  Out of these 10 million tokens, just over 4.2 million tokens will be distributed to Compound users over a 4-year period. The second biggest allotment (almost 2.4 million COMP) goes to the Compound Labs, Inc shareholders, whereas 2.2 million tokens will be distributed to the Compound founders and current team with a 4 year vesting schedule.  Finally, 775,000 COMP are reserved for community governance incentives and the remaining 332,000 tokens will be allocated to future team members.  The exact rate of COMP emission is subject to change over time, as voters are able to increase or reduce the emission rate by passing a proposal through  community governance .  How Is the Compound Network Secured? Everything on Compound is handled automatically by  smart contracts , which act to mint cTokens after  Ethereum  and  ERC20  assets are deposited, and allow Compound users to redeem their stake using their cTokens.  The protocol enforces a collateralization factor for all assets supported by the platform, ensuring each pool is overcollateralized at all times. If the collateral falls below the minimum maintenance level, it will be sold to liquidators at a 5% discount, paying down some of the loan and returning the remainder to an acceptable collateralization factor.  This arrangement helps to ensure borrowers maintain their collateral levels, provides a safety net for lenders, and creates an earning opportunity for liquidators.  Where Can You Buy Compound (COMP)? COMP is currently available to trade on hundreds of cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including  Coinbase Pro ,  Binance  and  Huobi Global . It can be traded against most other popular cryptocurrencies, as well as a range of fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar (USD), Indian rupee (INR) and Australian dollar (AUD).

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Zcash (ZEC)? Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency focused on privacy and anonymity. It uses the zk-SNARK zero-knowledge proof technology that allows nodes on the network to verify transactions without revealing any sensitive information about those transactions. Contrary to a common misunderstanding, the majority of cryptocurrencies on the market, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), are not anonymous, but rather  pseudonymous ; while they do not explicitly reveal the identities of their users, each user has their own public address or addresses which can be traced back to them via the methods of data science and  blockchain  forensics. Zcash transactions, on the other hand, still have to be relayed via a public blockchain, but unlike pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, ZEC transactions by default do not reveal the sending and receiving addresses or the amount being sent. There is an option, however, to reveal this data for the purposes of auditing or regulatory compliance. Zcash was first released on October 28, 2016, and it was originally based on Bitcoin’s codebase. Who Are the Founders of Zcash? Zcash was founded in 2016 by cypherpunk, computer security expert and entrepreneur Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn. He is also the founder of the for-profit Electronic Coin Company (ECC), which manages the development of Zcash. Wilcox-O’Hearn has spent more than 25 years in the industry of cryptography and information security and has contributed to a number of projects, including the now-defunct electronic money firm DigiCash, peer-to-peer data storing software Mojo Nation and the Tahoe Least-Authority File Store filesystem. He also founded Least Authority Enterprises, a technology company focused on improving digital security and preserving the fundamental right to privacy, and co-invented the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function. What Makes Zcash Unique? Zcash’s main advantage lies in its optional anonymity, which allows for a level of privacy unattainable with regular, pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or  Ethereum . ZEC transactions can be sent in two ways: transparent and shielded. Transparent transactions work in about the same way as in  Bitcoin , whose codebase Zcash was originally based on: they are sent between public addresses and are recorded on an immutable public ledger (the blockchain). All essential information about these transactions is available online for anyone to see, including the sending and receiving addresses and the amount sent. These public transactions do not reveal user identities in an overt manner: the only identifiers an outside observer can access from the blockchain are public addresses. However, through the efforts of data scientists and law enforcement over recent years, the methods of blockchain analysis have been developed to the point where an interested party can fairly reliably connect a public address on a blockchain to the real-world identity of its owner, essentially making private transactions impossible. Shielded ZEC transactions, on the other hand, leverage the technology of zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, or  zk-SNARKs , in order to enable completely anonymous transactions to be sent over a public immutable blockchain. The fact that the transaction  has  happened is recorded on the ledger, but the sending and receiving addresses and the amount sent is not revealed to the public. This allows Zcash to offer its users the right to privacy while still enjoying the advantages of a decentralized, permissionless digital currency.

Overall, Zcash tokenomics is similar to that of Bitcoin: it is a scarce  mineable  token with a total supply limit of 21 million coins. New ZECs are created in the form of “block subsidies”: whenever  a new block is mined  and added to the end of the blockchain, a certain amount of coins is minted and split into “miner subsidy” and “founders’ reward” at a ratio of 80 to 20 percent respectively. The block subsidy is halved at regular intervals to slow down the issuance rate as the total supply of ZEC approaches its limit of 21 million. The miner subsidy goes to the miner who has mined the latest block and the founders’ reward is distributed between Electronic Coin Company (ECC) founders, Zcash Foundation and ECC itself, as well as its employees. On Nov. 18, 2020, the block subsidy was halved from 6.25 ZEC to 3.125 ZEC, which was triggered at block 1,046,400. This was introduced under the  Zcash Canopy  upgrade, which also removed the Founders Reward. Instead, the remaining 20% will be divided among the Major Grants Fund, ECC and Zcash Foundation, at 8%, 7% and 5% respectively. The next, and fifth,  Zcash network upgrade  —  Zcash NU5  — is estimated to go live on the testnet on Sept. 30, 2021.  Since launch there has been substantial interest in the  ZEC to AUD  and  ZEC to EUR  price pairs. How Is the Zcash Network Secured? Zcash network is secured by the  proof-of-work   SHA-256  hash function which belongs to the SHA-2 set of algorithms — same as Bitcoin. Where Can You Buy Zcash (ZEC)? Zcash is a high-ranking cryptocurrency. It is possible to  buy Zcash  on a number of major exchanges, some of which are: Binance HitBTC Huobi Global BKEX OKEx Our most recent articles about  Zcash : Crypto Is Not Anonymous: How Criminals Are Caught on the Blockchain Cryptocurrency Money Laundering What Are Privacy Coins?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Dogecoin? Dogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular \"doge\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was  created by  Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin. How Do You Mine Dogecoin? Dogecoin differs from Bitcoin's proof-of-work protocol in several ways, one of which is by using Scrypt technology. The altcoin has also a block time of 1 minute, and the total supply is uncapped, which means that there is no limit to the number of Dogecoin that can be mined.\nYou can mine Dogecoin either solo, or by joining a mining pool. A Doge miner can mine the digital currency on Windows, Mac or Linux, and with a GPU. As of 2014, you can also mine Litecoin in the same process of mining Dogecoin, as the processes were merged. What Can Dogecoin Be Used For? Dogecoin has been used primarily as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter to reward the creation or sharing of quality content. You can get tipped Dogecoin by participating in a community that uses the digital currency, or you can get your Dogecoin from a Dogecoin faucet. A Dogecoin faucet is a website that will give you a small amount of Dogecoin for free as an introduction to the currency, so that you can begin interacting in Dogecoin communities. How Can You Buy Dogecoin? You can sell or  buy Dogecoin  at any exchange that offers the digital currency, store it on an exchange or in a Dogecoin wallet, and tip Dogecoin in any communities that accept Dogecoin.

Dogecoin Foundation and Board of Advisors In 2014, a not-for-profit foundation was formed by members of the Dogecoin team to provide support, advocacy, trademark protection and governance for the cryptocurrency project. However, the foundation was dissolved over time. After several years of being inactive, the foundation was relaunched in 2021 with a “renewed focus on supporting the Dogecoin Ecosystem, community and promoting the future of the Dogecoin Blockchain.” In addition to some of the original core team, the project now has some seasoned industry players as part of its board of advisors. According to  the foundation’s website , members of the board will meet monthly to discuss issues relating to Dogecoin. In regards to its advisors, the group is made up of Dogecoin founder Billy Markus, the project’s core developer Max Keller, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk as represented by the head of the Musk’s family office, Jared Birchall. Members of the Board of Advisors will function in various capacities. While Keller will serve as the project’s technical advisor, Markus will be in charge of the community and memes. Meanwhile, Buterin will function as the blockchain and crypto advisor for the foundation, and Birchall will represent Elon Musk as legal and financial advisor. As a first assignment, the Board of Advisors will be working to secure three-year funding that would allow it to employ a small, dedicated staff to work on Dogecoin full-time. Up until now, the work on the ecosystem has been done by volunteers.

Trust Wallet Token, or TWT, is a simple BEP-20 utility token that provides a range of benefits and incentives to Trust Wallet users. Trust Wallet itself is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet that supports dozens of popular native assets, in addition to popular tokens on the Ethereum, Binance and  TRON  blockchains. Holders of TWT tokens unlock a variety of benefits when using Trust Wallet, including discounts on in-app cryptocurrency purchases and on the use of decentralized exchange ( DEX ) services. TWT holders can also participate in the governance of Trust Wallet and can vote on Trust Wallet update proposals, helping to shape the development of the app.  Trust Wallet Token was initially launched as a BEP-2 asset on Binance Chain, but was relaunched as a BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain in October 2020. Who Are the Founders of Trust Wallet Token Trust Wallet was founded by Viktor Radchenko in 2017. Based in Mountain View, California, Radchenko previously held development and engineering roles at several tech firms, and also co-founded Trucker Path in 2013 — the company behind one of the most popular apps for truckers and logistics firms.  Radchenko turned his attention to the mobile cryptocurrency wallet industry when he found that “app stores did not have any open source wallets for  Ethereum  and ERC20 tokens.” The platform was acquired by  Binance  in July 2018 for an undisclosed sum, but Radchenko still works on the platform as part of the Binance team. The full  Trust Wallet team  is not public, but it is known to comprise over 20 individuals — many of which have overlapping roles at Binance.  What Makes Trust Wallet Token Unique? Trust Wallet Token is a utility token designed to provide additional value to users of the Trust Wallet mobile app — it doesn’t have any utility outside of the Trust Wallet ecosystem.  Despite this, as a BEP-20 asset, Trust Wallet Tokens can be transferred to any wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain assets, where it may be exchanged against other assets or used as payment for services. Since it also confers voting rights and governance over the development of Trust Wallet and can be used for discounted DEX trades and in-app purchases, TWT has gone on to develop value of its own as a speculative instrument.  TWT was also one of the first tokens to launch on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) — a high-performance  blockchain  designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications ( DApps ). As a result, TWT can be transferred with extremely low fees and near-instant transaction confirmation times.

Stay on top of the market with the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Coins Are There in Circulation? As part of the transition to Binance Smart Chain, 99% of the original TWT token supply was burned and the new maximum supply was set at 1 billion TWT — of this, just over a quarter is currently in circulation.  The circulating supply of TWT will gradually grow as TWT tokens are earned by Trust Wallet users for completing various tasks, such as by participating in referral campaigns, taking quizzes and completing tasks within the app — like cryptocurrency  staking  and trading. As per the  official source , 40% of the TWT token supply will be targeted towards user acquisition, 15% will be distributed to the Trust Wallet community, 30% will be held in reserve and 15% is allocated to developers. As of October 2020, Trust Wallet has not yet published the full tokenomics or emission schedule for the Trust Wallet Token.  How Is the Trust Wallet Token Network Secured? Based on Binance Smart Chain, the Trust Wallet Token is backed by a rigorously tested  proof-of-stake (POS)  consensus mechanism. This is used to protect the network against a range of potential threats, including  51%  and Sybil attacks.  It’s also protected by a generous bug bounty program operated by Binance, which pays up to $10,000 in BNB to anybody that discovers a vulnerability on Binance Chain and its core smart contracts.  Beyond this, as a BEP-20 asset, TWT is secured by the security of the wallet software used to manage it. For Trust Wallet, this includes a passcode security lock and a 12-word recovery phrase.  Where Can You Buy Trust Wallet Token (TWT)? Trust Wallet Token is available to purchase and trade on a variety of platforms — including both centralized and decentralized exchanges.  MXC  and  Binance DEX  are among the most liquid exchanges for TWT. The token is currently tradable against a range of other cryptocurrencies, including  Tether (USDT) , Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB).

It has a circulating supply of 658,039 VNLA coins   and a max. supply of 1,000,000 VNLA coins. What is the Vanilla Network? \n Founded in August 2020 by an array of professionals ranging from finance, marketing and computer programming, the Vanilla Network is a deflationary ERC-20 token. A staking platform will govern the heart of the ecosystem. The Vanilla Network relies on fundamental economics to produce an equilibrium price, being demand and supply. This is where the Vanilla Network differ from other platforms; the focus is on generating demand whilst the supply will continue to burn on a transactional basis. The Vanilla Network will be releasing on a periodic basis revolutionary staking and betting dApps that can be used and will appeal to all therefore, generating consumer demand. At the heart of this is the “community fund” also known as the DAO, decentralized autonomous organization in computer programming. This fund will self-cycle, being funded and replenished by wins and losses in the betting dApps. This is much like the ‘house’ in a casino however; all of these funds belong to the community and not the owners of the casino. Ultimately, the aim being to decentralize the betting exchange platform. There should be no losers, all margins are returned to holders of the Vanilla token if they continue to stake. What betting dApps will be ‘Revolutionary’? \n The Vanilla Option staking pool is simple to understand but extremely effective. All stakeholders in this option will routinely receive rewards based on transactions in the ecosystem. This equates to a huge 2.5% per transaction (the token burns at 5% per transaction, meaning 50% is returned to stakeholders with 2.5% of supply burned from the entire ecosystem). In order to generate transactional demand, will be the following betting dApps. (1) Head to Head bets. Community members can initiate a specific event (such as LA Lakers vs. Miami Heat, in the NBA) which will generate a smart contract to allow participants to choose a particular outcome. Based on the level engagement the odds will auto generate. The winner will then be approved, and receive tokens in line with the final outcome. (2) Double of nothing rewards. Never done before in the Blockchain, this will allow users to attempt to double their rewards by using randomization on the Blockchain. A user does not have to participate in this option, but free tokens making more free tokens is an opportunity that does not come by on a daily basis. (3) Blackjack, community poker, lotto and many more! The Vanilla Network will continue to build and bring these crowd pleasers to the Blockchain. What are the token economics? \n Max Supply: 1,000,000 burns to 100,000 VANILLA\nBurn per transaction : 5%\nRewards per transaction returned to stakeholders: 2.5% Where to Buy? \n Currently the Vanilla Network token is available to buy on Uniswap and the WhiteBit exchange. Many more exchanges are expected to come as the ecosystem continues to evolve. Here are some other articles that you may be interested in: What Is a Crypto Faucet? What Are Crypto Debit Cards?

ShapeShift was founded in 2014, originally as a privately held company based in Switzerland. However, in June 2021, the organization announced that it was becoming a fully decentralized project, open sourcing all of its source code and turning ownership and governance over to the community of FOX Token holders. It’s founder, Bitcoin pioneer Erik Voorhees, stated this decentralized model “is the only way to maintain user sovereignty.” How Many FOX Tokens Are There in Circulation? \n The total capped supply of FOX is 1,000,001,337 tokens.  34% were granted to over 1.1M ShapeShift customers and DeFi community members in the world’s largest token airdrop on June 30 2021. 32% were granted to employees and shareholders before decentralization. These vest over three years from June 2, 2021 24.2% were granted to the FOXDEN—the DAO governance treasury of the now decentralized ShapeShift.  7.5% were granted to the ShapeShift Foundation—a non-profit tasked with facilitating the transition to decentralization. 1.3% were retained by ShapeShift. 1% was already in circulation, held by over 21,000 ShapeShift users before the airdrop distribution event.  Who Are the Founders of ShapeShift? \n ShapeShift was founded by Erik Voorhees and Jon ShapeShift (pseudonym). Erik Voorhees is among the top-recognized serial crypto advocates and entrepreneurs, communicating the virtues of Bitcoin as one of the most important inventions ever created. Having been a featured guest on Bloomberg, Fox Business, CNBC, RT, BBC Radio, and numerous crypto industry events, Erik humbly suggests that there is no such thing as a “free market” when the institution of money itself is centrally planned and controlled. Before founding ShapeShift, Voorhees was the creator of SatoshiDICE, which popularized the concept of provable fairness and was responsible for most of the world’s Bitcoin transactions in 2012 and 2013. Prior to that, Erik was Head of Marketing at BitInstant in NYC.  Jon ShapeShift was Chief Product Officer and co-founder of ShapeShift and was responsible for driving product strategy, leading product development teams and efforts, and designing solutions that integrate the changing landscape of crypto, decentralized finance, and macroeconomics in general. He has been deeply involved in the founding and pioneering of online gaming and cryptocurrency platform companies, helping to propel ShapeShift to being one of the most internationally recognized crypto brands in the industry. Where Can I Access ShapeShift, or Buy FOX Tokens? \nVisit ShapeShift.com, where you can begin trading, or download the app. FOX Tokens are available for trading on a growing number of exchanges, such as Uniswap v2 and v3. Through ShapeShift’s integration with 0x, which aggregates liquidity from Uniswap and over a dozen other DEXs, FOX can be traded in ShapeShift’s web and mobile app. New to cryptocurrency?

NFTX is down 15.29% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #631, with a live market cap of $49,934,160 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 404,286 NFTX coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  NFTX , the top exchanges for trading in  NFTX  are currently  Gate.io ,   AEX ,   Sushiswap ,   Poloniex ,    and   Hotbit .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is NFTX (NFTX)? NFTX is a community-owned protocol and  platform  for creating non-fungible token ( NFT )-backed  ERC-20   tokens . Notably, NFTX powers the creation and trading of funds, tracking sought-after NFT collectibles such as CryptoKitties, CypherPunks and others. NFTX was launched in early January 2021 to provide an essential new service to the booming NFT sector through indexing of projects. Although these tokens represent index funds, they’re composable and fungible, which means they are interchangeable for other tokens, which distinguishes them from standard NFT protocols. These “funds” are actively traded on  decentralized exchanges  (DEXs) such as  Sushiswap  and  Uniswap . The platform’s unique value  proposition  is to bring NFTs to light to high-level individuals trading funds based on leading non-fungible tokens like  PUNK  and  AXIE  on Uniswap and other DEXs.  Who Are the Founders of NFTX? NFTX is a community-controlled platform that allows users to place index funds on the  Ethereum   blockchain . Therefore, the project’s governance depends on a  decentralized autonomous organization  (DAO). However, to prevent monopoly during decision-making, a proposal targeting new changes needs to garner support from 80% of all voting tokens. Note that the voting period lasts for 24 hours. What Makes NFTX Unique? The main business case for the project is to bridge the gap between  decentralized finance  (DeFi) and NFTs. The NFTX platform supports two types of funds, D1 and D2 funds: D1 funds have a 1:1 ratio backing involving an NFT and an Ethereum-based ERC20 contract.  For example : say Alice owns 1 ZOMBIE-FEMALE, this allows her to redeem precisely 1 Zombie Female at random. On the other hand, D2 funds, also called top-level funds, are  Balancer  pools that make up a combination of D1 funds.  To illustrate: The D2 fund AVASTR makes up a combination of 3 D1 Avastar funds AVASTR-BASIC, AVASTR-RANK-30 and AVASTR-RANK-60 to give users diversified exposure to AVASTR without the need to hold and manage multiple tokens.  Arguably, NFTX seeks to replicate indexes like DefiPulse or CoinMarketCap, but with an NFT twist. As the defacto wrapped-NFT funds issuer, the platform expands its use case to include the representation of items like digital lottery tickets, in-game items, digital collectibles in the form of NFTs. However, the services come with a price tag. NFTX charges a fee of 2.5% on the burn and mint operations. NFTX seeks growth through offering NFT-ERC-20 loans and on-chain  liquidity . For the loans, NFT holders don’t have to relinquish ownership, while on-chain liquidity helps curb illiquidity and wash trading. Related Pages: Learn more about  NFTX Hashmasks Index (MASK) .

NFTX’s total supply stands at 650,000, with 10% of the token distribution allocated to the founder, while NFT contributions account for 30%. Ethereum (ETH) contributions, NFTX liquidity, and farming account for 30%, 10% and 20%, respectively. Note that funds allocated to the founder have a five-year vesting period.  Furthermore, token holders have a right to contribute to the decision-making process. How Is the NFTX Network Secured? Since the platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, its security relies on the second-largest blockchain network after Bitcoin. Notably, NFTX uses the safety of the Ethereum-side, which is currently powered by both  proof-of-stake  (PoS) and  proof-of-work  (PoW) consensus mechanisms. Note that the protocol’s native asset, NFTX, leverages Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standards, one of the first token standards in the space. Consequently, it provides diverse and battle-tested security measures. Where Can You Buy NFTX (NFTX)? The NFTX token is available on both  centralized exchanges  and DEXs such as Uniswap,  1inch , and  Hotbit . On Uniswap, it’s paired with wrapped Ethereum (WETH) while traders on 1inch choose between Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and  yearn.finance token  (YFI). Hotbit only has one pair, NFTX/USDT.

The goal of this is to allow application developers to have  smart contracts  that can access much more computing power when it is required, or maintain the same power at lower costs for tasks such as trials for onboarding new users or applications that simply do not need the full security of blockchain to begin with.  In this system you have the ability to interact with APIs developed by third parties which are not on chain. Loom attempts to be the ultimate platform that allows smart contract developers to create applications without the need to switch to another programming language.  As such, they can easily integrate their applications with the outside world. The Loom Network runs on Plasma, which is a scaling solution that allows for faster transactions throughout the network. Who Are the Founders of Loom Network? The Loom Network was founded by Matthew Campbell, James Martin Duffy and Luke Zhang in 2017.

The protocol is built on the Automated Market Maker ( AMM ) model, which gives Ethereum users free access to the ZKSwap service. Thus, users can trade  ETH  and  ERC-20  tokens on ZKSwap, plus receive ZKS (management token ZKSwap) through community  mining  – the maintenance of liquidity and security of the ZKSwap infrastructure.  To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  ZKSwap . Holders of ZKS tokens take part in the life of the exchange; they can vote for the listing of tokens, as well as influence the development and modification of the protocol. The scalability and confidentiality of the project is realized due to the ZK-Rollup technology and a set of uniswap functions implemented in Layer-2. The ZKSwap team launched the testnet back in November 2020, and on Feb. 15, 2021, the mainnet on Ethereum was started. In February 2021, the crypto exchange carried out an airdrop, distributing 80 million $ZKS. Who Are the Founders of ZKSwap? As of July 2021, the ZKSwap team remains anonymous. From the available information, ZKSwap is developed by L2Lab and the lead developer of the project is Alex Lee – a specialist with rich experience in  zero knowledge proof  research and  smart contract  development. ZKSwap employs about 20 qualified blockchain developers, many of whom joined the crypto industry in 2013. The team has investors from major Chinese VCs, including Bixin Capital, FBG Capital and Longling Capital. What Makes ZKSwap (ZKS) Unique? ZKSwap is an AMM modeled Layer-2 DEX using ZK-Rollups technology – a type of Level-2 scalable solution in the Ethereum network based on  zero knowledge proof . Compared to similar solutions, ZK-Rollup highlights a number of advantages: security, cost, transactions per second (TPS) and privacy. The technology reduces the load on the main network by an order of magnitude. This is done by grouping transactions and taking some calculations outside of Ethereum. ZKSwap is a decentralized project led by the community. The platform benefits are: decentralized, complete control over users’ assets; no authorization requested for transactions, and a highly liquid process while maintaining a stable level of confidentiality; ultra high TPS due to the ZK-Rollup; liquidity providers and users do not have to pay high  gas  fees. ZKSwap operates as follows: the protocol is available via the application at zks.app and you need an Ethereum wallet to connect to it. Users trade tokens through Ethereum smart contracts and add assets to the ZKSwap liquidity pool. The ZK-Rollups system bundles and processes user transactions off-chain at Level-2 and then syncs with the main network, eliminating low Ethereum throughput and high fees. The ZKSwap architecture consists of a front-end user interface (UI),  on-chain  smart contracts and an off-chain ZKSwap server (includes memory pool, block proposer, state keeper, prover server). The ZKSwap server is the module that handles all off-network transactions. The technological component is two main developments – Layer-2 server and Plonk zero-knowledge proof system. Thanks to WebSocket, the ZKSwap server interacts with the platform users and the interface has a transaction tracking function. All approved requests go to the ZKSwap memory pool and are processed by the swap engine. As for the ZKSwap's zero-knowledge proof system, the technology relies on a distribution architecture and side-by-side developments to create evidence, namely the zero-knowledge proof algorithm – Plonk.

Find out with  CMC Alexandria . What is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)? The answer is  here . How Many ZKSwap (ZKS) Coins Are There in Circulation? ZKS is an ERC-20 token issued by the ZKSwap project with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. The distribution ratio of ZKS is as follows: 60% to community mining; 15% to the ZKSwap team; 8% to ecosystem developers and ecosystem growth; 6.7% to angel investors; 5.3% to potential A-round investors; 4% to the initial liquidity; 1% to advisors. ZKS is a major component of the ZKSwap system and can be used in the following scenarios: Governance. ZKS holders can initiate proposals for updating and improving the protocol. All token holders have the right to vote, so proposals that receive the majority of votes are accepted and the development team takes responsibility for implementation. Voting/pledge for listing. The platform supports limited trading pairs, except for the pairs set by the ZKSwap team. Holders of ZKS take part in the voting, and furthermore, they have the opportunity to initiate a listing proposal. By gaining a majority of votes, holders can place a coin. Finally, users with a significant amount of ZKS can pledge their tokens for listing. How Is the ZKSwap Network Secured? ZKSwap deploys a series of  smart contracts  on the Ethereum blockchain, which are the key link between Ethereum and the ZKSwap exchange server. They store tokens, update balances and provide a secure environment. Separately, the liquidity and security of ZKSwap are ensured by the users of the exchange themselves with community mining. Participants in the process receive rewards in ZKS tokens. Community mining includes: provision of liquidity (Proof-of-Liquidity-Mining or PoL), payment of commissions on the Ethereum network (Proof-of-Gas or PoG), generation of zero-knowledge proofs (Proof-of-ZK-Snarks or PoZK) and trading on ZKSwap (Proof-of-TransFee or PoT). On top of that, ZKSwap implements ZKS staking (smart contract staking). The Proof-of-Stake ( PoS )  consensus mechanism  is actively involved in this procedure. Through this method, the blockchain confirms transactions and prevents problems. PoS reduces risks of cyber attacks, as the structure deter miners from fraudulent activities. Where Can You Buy ZKSwap (ZKS)? The ZKSwap exchange credits ZKS to airdrop and community mining participants. ZKS is also available for trading on major exchanges against other cryptocurrencies, these include:  Huobi Global ,  Gate.io ,  Uniswap (V2) ,  Poloniex ,  ProBit  and  ProBit Global ,  LBank ,  BitWell ,  BitZ ,  1inch Exchange ,  BiKi ,  CoinTiger ,  Hotbit ,  Pionex ,  Bilaxy ,  HitBTC ,  Huobi Indonesia ,  CoinW ,  TokenIon ,  WBF Exchange ,  MEXC ,  CoinBene  and  Jubi .

It has a circulating supply of 6,615,038 NXM coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  NXM , the top exchange for trading in  NXM  is currently  Nexus Mutual .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is NXM (NXM)? Launched in May 2019, Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance protocol built on Ethereum. It offers users the ability to take out covers on smart contracts through the usage of its native token NXM. Nexus Mutual uses a risk-sharing pool that allows anyone to purchase on insurance cover or contribute their capital to the pool for future rewards. Nexus Mutual tries to disrupt the insurance industry by transitioning the power over the pooled resources to the individual people. Anyone is allowed to participate, as the mutual is owned by its members. Users can contribute Ethereum ( ETH ) to the pool for NXM. Who Are the Founders of NXM? NXM was founded by Hugh Karp. Before founding NXM, he worked as the CFO of Munich Re. He has also worked as an actuary in life insurance at MLC & Nab Health. What Makes NXM Unique? Nexus Mutual is taking on the issue of smart contract vulnerability and provides users with a level of protection that can help avoid losses. Nexus Mutual’s first product were smart contract covers that provided protection for value storing contracts. In order for the project to start processing claims, it needed to reach a pool of 12,000 ETH, which was achieved two months after the launch. The NXM token represents the membership rights in Nexus Mutual, along with the ability to participate within the ecosystem through claim and risk assessments and governance. The token leverages a bonding curve to determine the price, which is driven by how much capital the Mutual has and how much capital it needs to meet all of the claims with a certain probability. Users can stake NXM to vote on claim assessments and on whether or not a certain claim needs to be paid out. The members who decide to vote in accordance with the consensus are rewarded with NXM, whereas the ones that vote against it have their tokens locked for a period of time.  Members fulfill several roles, one of which is that of assessing the risk of each smart contract. Whenever a claim is filed, they are responsible for voting on the legitimacy of that claim and on whether the payout can be made or not. Members can also use their tokens to vote on smart contracts based on how secure they think each particular contract is. The more NXM is staked on a smart contract, the cheaper it becomes to purchase cover for it; the large amount at stake is an indicator that the contract is considered safe by many members.

With a team of coordinators and developers from across the globe, this community-based project aims to be the first and most widely used cryptocurrency on the market. With its native coin XEP, Electra Protocol perceives itself as becoming a popular payment processing option, using data money without the complexities of the current forms of payment infrastructures.  Electra Protocol Features Electra Protocol by itself is a standalone, ultra-fast, and secure form of data money with near-zero processing fees. When placed together with its flagship product, ElectaPay, one can witness its true potential.  ElectraPay is a payment solution for e-commerce merchants who are looking for the alternative payment methods that cryptocurrency provides. In other words, it is a complete financial management system that will allow merchants to quickly adopt an alternative payment method that is not dependent upon payment service providers, banks, or credit card companies to complete transactions. This unique payment solution will offer many advantages that traditional payment platforms fail to give merchants.

In addition to ElectraPay, Electra Protocol is expanding its scope from not only being a payment focused coin to a project that can facilitate multiple use cases. An example of this is a pilot currently taking place with a company in the food production industry that uses the Electra Protocol blockchain for product traceability in its supply chain. The first responses from the company's international customers are very positive. This feedback has encouraged the team to continue to explore this path.  The Electra Protocol team is currently working towards a business model that will provide partners with all the necessary software and tools to enable the project's technology monetization.

As a member, Electra Protocol is taking its seat and joining committees that contribute to ETA's focus on payment technologies. The opportunity to be a part of the association will help Electra Protocol as it continues to grow its network of key industry groups and individuals.

Spartan Protocol is up 26.80% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #705, with a live market cap of $37,041,376 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 85,674,313 SPARTA coins   and a max. supply of 300,000,000 SPARTA coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Spartan Protocol , the top exchanges for trading in  Spartan Protocol  are currently  Binance ,   PancakeSwap (V2) ,    and   MEXC .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Spartan Protocol (SPARTA)? Spartan Protocol is a Decentralised Finance (Defi) project built ontop of Binance Smart Chain ( BSC ). With a focus on incentivised liquidity pools and SyntheticYield Assets, Spartan Protocol allows users to earn revenue by providing liquidity to pools and create derivative tokens through Synthetic Assets.  Notable similar projects are  Uniswap  on the Ethereum ( ETH ) network & and  ThorChain . Bringing these features to the BSC network allows users to take advantage of BSC's low gas fees and fast settlements. Who Are the Founders of Spartan Protocol? Spartan Protocol was founded by a community of developers of former Binance Chain projects with a strong vision of decentralisation. At it's inception, all SPARTA tokens were acquired by a Proof-of-burn process of selected BEP20 tokens, thus there isn't any founder/team tokens or treasury. With the use of DAO governance, every token holder has a voice and thus Spartan Protocol was built by the community for the community. What Makes Spartan Protocol Unique? At is core, Spartan Protocol provides incentivized liquidity pools that are facilitated by an automated market maker ( AMM ) algorithm that has liquidity-sensitive fees. AMM algorithm provides transparency while reducing slippage and latency caused by human intervention/manipulation. With liquidity-sensitive fees, it is ensured that the system will be able to detect correct token purchasing at all times thus resulting in scalable and risk-tolerant growth. Coupled with various other features like Synths and Lending, the use cases for the underlying pools increase thus resulting in higher revenue generation with higher APYs. Synthetic assets  is a fairly unique part of Spartan Protocol, through the generation of synthetic assets, users can create derivative tokens that allows users to go long or short on various markets without having the need to own the particular asset. Synthetic assets are generated through the use of price anchors offered by the liquidity pools on Spartan Protocol and collateralized by liquidity pool shares. The liquidity pool shares are on-market, value-stabilized and can be instantly liquidated. Liquidity-sensitive fees ensure that positions taken up will scale with the depth of the available liquidity, preventing the deleveraging spirals that are common in many similar systems. The Spartan DAO is a mechanism that is used to govern the entire ecosystem and distribute protocol incentives. How Is the Spartan Protocol Network Secured? Spartan Protocol is based on the Binance Smart Chain, a VM-compatible delegated proof-of-stake ( DPoS ) blockchain with fast block times and a focus on decentralization.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Verge (XVG)? Verge is a privacy-focused  cryptocurrency  and  blockchain  that seeks to offer a fast, efficient, decentralized payments network that improves upon the original  Bitcoin  (BTC) blockchain. It includes additional privacy features including integrating the anonymity network Tor into its wallet, called vergePay, and providing the option of sending transactions to stealth addresses. The project describes itself as community-driven, relying on volunteers and priding itself on being open source. Verge was first  launched  in October 2014 as DogeCoinDark, a fork of  Peercoin  (PPC). In February 2016, it was  renamed  Verge in order to  rebrand  for easier mass-market adoption and to distinguish itself from  Dogecoin  (DOGE), with which it has no direct connection. The project is now based on the Bitcoin source code. Who Are the Founders of Verge? Verge was launched in 2016 by Justin Valo, also known as \"Justin Vendetta\" or \"Sunerok,\" a developer with over 20 years of  experience  in network security and nearly a decade in blockchain technology. He first developed the cryptocurrency as a fun passion project to empower individuals around the world with a greater sense of privacy. Valo has  stated  that he has been programming since the age of 8 and became involved in network administration after high school, working for a Fortune 500 company. After a few years, he decided to start his own network security company. Valo first became interested in Bitcoin in 2011, later getting  involved  with Dogecoin after its late 2013 launch. He began working on Verge because he  believed  that none of the altcoins being developed at the time were adequately functional as digital currencies and that the only other serious privacy coin projects ---  Bytecoin  (BCN) and  Monero  (XMR) --- were not sufficient. In 2017, Valo was  appointed  to the advisory board of  TokenPay  (TPAY), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. What Makes Verge Unique? According to its \"blackpaper,\" Verge was  created  as a way to fulfill Bitcoin founder  Satoshi Nakamoto's  vision of a decentralized, trustless electronic payment system while also providing more privacy than is available with Bitcoin. In order to accomplish this goal, Verge relies on a series of key privacy features. It automatically routes all traffic to and from its vergePay wallet through the Tor network, anonymizing the traffic and masking IP addresses. It also offers dual-key stealth addressing, through which senders can create one-time wallet addresses on behalf of recipients to help protect the recipients' privacy, as well as using  atomic swaps  to power trustless  peer-to-peer  cross-blockchain transactions. Verge seeks mainstream adoption, and as such, the Verge Core team pursues strategic partnerships to increase its awareness and use. It  sponsors  professional athletes and has partnered with platforms such as payments and rewards ecosystem  MobiePay , crypto payments platform and ATM provider  MeconCash , and blockchain-based online gambling platform  Crazy8Token , among others. The Verge Core team often  relies on  crowdfunding and community support to be able to scale, market and pursue partnerships. In April 2018, the project  raised  75 million XVG ( approximately  $7 million at the time) to cover the costs of integrating with a major payments processor.

Read an  in-depth exploration  of anonymity within crypto on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource. Stay up to date on the latest in crypto privacy and security with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many Verge (XVG) Coins Are There in Circulation? The total maximum supply of Verge is capped at 16.5 billion XVG. According to Verge, the supply cap is  intentionally  high as a way to ensure that the value of each individual token remains low, allowing users to avoid fractional payments. It also makes it more difficult for any one individual to take control of a large number of XVG in order to manipulate markets. The cryptocurrency did not have an  initial coin offering , nor was there any premining of tokens. As such, the Verge development team has said it does not hold a significant amount of XVG. Rather, all currently circulating XVG was introduced through the Verge blockchain's  proof-of-work  mining process, which is multialgorithmic and supports Scrypt, X17, Lyra2rev2, Myr-groestl and Blake2s. Verge undergoes a periodic halving event that reduces the amount of XVG miners receive as a block reward by 50%. Under the current emission  schedule , rewards are halved every 500,000 blocks. How Is the Verge Network Secured? The Verge network is secured through a proof-of-work  consensus  algorithm similar to that of Bitcoin, on which Verge's code is based. At least 51% of all full nodes in the network must agree that a transaction is valid in order for it to be added to the blockchain, and new blocks are created through the mining process, in which users compete among one another to solve complex, energy-intensive problems. However, unlike Bitcoin, Verge supports five different mining algorithms. According to the development team, this makes the network more secure, as more people are able to participate in the mining process. In April 2018, Verge  suffered  an attack on its network that used an exploit related to the Scrypt mining algorithm to instamine a  reported  20 million XVG. In response, the project initiated a hard fork to patch the issue. While it was widely referred to as a  51% attack , founder and lead developer Valo  denied  this, saying it was actually a timewarp attack, which involves manipulating block timestamps in order to reduce mining difficulty. Where Can You Buy Verge (XVG)? XVG is available to purchase on many exchanges including  Binance ,  HitBTC ,  Bittrex  and  Huobi Global . It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  and  Ether  (ETH), and the  stablecoin   Tether  (USDT) Are you interested in buying XVG or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin ?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is HUSD (HUSD)? HUSD is a secure, reliable, and fiat-collateralized  stablecoin . It combines the stability of the US dollar and the efficiency of blockchain technology. Additionally, it provides holders with a tool to reduce volatility when trading in the cryptocurrency market. When designing the project, the development team focused on security, liquidity and convenience. HUSD was created to provide price stability to attract a serious crypto trading audience and simplify interactions with global markets.  Developers announced the HUSD project in 2019. Later, Stable Universal released HUSD in compliance with all required US legal requirements. This organization attracts skilled developers to ensure they provide the safest and most reliable services to end-users. HUSD is issued as an  ERC-20  token on the Ethereum blockchain and is backed at a 1:1 ratio by US dollars held in US bank accounts. The HUSD token is held in reserve by the Paxos Trust Company. This measure is essential to provide oversight and support from the regulatory authorities. Every month, a leading US auditing firm conducts tests to ensure that USD reserves are matched against HUSD supplies. The HUSD token (the name a combination of Huobi and USD) is listed on the  Huobi Global  exchange platform and can be converted to any of these four stablecoins:  PAX ,  TUSD ,  GUSD , and  USDC . Investors can also deposit and withdraw stablecoins using the all-in-one stablecoin solution. Who Are the Founders of HUSD? Frank Zhang is the honorable founder and CEO of Stable Universal. The company is headquartered in Central District, Hong Kong, and Stable Universal operates in the Financial Services sector. Prior to that, Zhang worked at the Bank of China (New York) as BSA Officer, AVP. Claude Gu is another HUSD team member. His role at Stable Universal is Senior Overseas Operations Manager. Gu studied digital and graphic communication at Hong Kong Baptist University, and holds an MA in new media from the same university. In 2016, he was Senior Digital Account Executive at SAME SAME but different (Paris). In 2018, he focused on Corporate Social Media Operations at Lenovo (Beijing), and in 2020 he joined Stable Universal. Shi Deng is the final founder of HUSD. He is the designated BSA Officer and Compliance Director at Stable Universal. Deng was educated at Fudan University (Bachelor of Laws) and at Fordham University (Master of Laws). He became a part of Stable Universal in 2019. What Makes HUSD (HUSD) Unique? The HUSD team is committed to providing a secure and interoperable product in the form of a dollar-pegged stablecoin. The developers understand stablecoins are a rapidly developing segment that could be the missing puzzle piece to mass crypto adoption. HUSD was first launched in 2018 and was listed on the Huobi Global exchange. The main idea of the stablecoin was to combine four others — Paxos Standard (PAX), True USD (TUSD), USD Coin (USDC), and Gemini Dollars (GUSD) — into one HUSD token. However, users didn’t want to trade using HUSD, as the token pricing seemed opaque to them. Huobi then decided that the stablecoin should not depend on the exchange. In 2019, Stable Universal and Paxos stepped in to secure the ERC-20 HUSD stablecoin. Since then, Huobi has transferred the previous stablecoin to a new and universal one. The HUSD cryptocurrency is a token based on the  Ethereum  blockchain. HUSD exists as an ERC-20 token, allowing it to be integrated with Ethereum-based applications. When a user needs to redeem HUSD, they send tokens to the address for which Stable Universal is responsible. There (via Paxos), tokens are transferred into fiat currency to the user's bank account. This allows traders and exchanges to use HUSD as an alternative to fiat currencies. Features that make HUSD stand out: Every dollar supporting the HUSD token is held in reserve by Paxos Trust Company. This means that the HUSD token fulfills the industry's established requirements for stablecoins. It is completely integrated with Huobi Global, one of the most well-known liquid exchanges in the cryptocurrency world. The platform has a quick, straightforward login (and logout) through a service launched by Stable Universal. With its help, you can easily purchase and redeem HUSD tokens.

HUSD is a 1:1 ERC-20 token pegged to the US dollar. As of June 2021, 555,449,408 tokens were issued, the same amount in circulation. The total supply of HUSD is backed by fiat currency, which is held in the Paxos reserve. If there is a request for the purchase (or redemption) of HUSD tokens, then cash is transferred to the reserve and back. The only party that can affect the turnover of HUSD tokens is Stable Universal. The organization issues tokens when users' fiat currency is deposited into a Paxos account. And when tokens are redeemed for fiat deposits in Paxos bank accounts, Stable Universal destroys the tokens. To demonstrate the system's solvency, HUSD resorts to a reserve confirmation system to provide full collateral. Moreover, Stable Universal publishes reports that prove the existence of the dollar reserves, which keep the tokens in circulation. The HUSD token can also be used to pay for a variety of goods and services. How Is the HUSD Network Secured? HUSD is a highly decentralized and secure token that was built on top of the Ethereum network. HUSD transactions follow instructions laid out by ERC-20  smart contracts . This aspect eliminates the need to use third parties by relying on the secure and tested blockchain network. Furthermore, you shouldn’t have any problems with trading tokens, because all movements are supported by a considerable number of exchanges and wallet applications that Ethereum supports. HUSD is audited and secured by SlowMist, and the platform complies with Know Your Customer ( KYC ) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Where Can You Buy HUSD (HUSD)? Here are the steps to purchase HUSD:  Log in  to your HUSD account (or sign up); Verify your identity; Make a dollar deposit; Place an order to buy HUSD tokens. The main crypto exchange platforms where you can trade HUSD tokens include:  Huobi Global ,  Gate.io ,  MDEX ,  Hotbit ,  Pionex ,  Hoo ,  0x Protocol ,  Tokenlon ,  NUT MONEY , and  BHEX (BlueHelix Exchange) .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Tezos (XTZ)? Tezos is a blockchain network that’s based on smart contracts, in a way that’s not too dissimilar to Ethereum. However, there’s a big difference: Tezos aims to offer infrastructure that is more advanced — meaning it can evolve and improve over time without there ever being a danger of a hard fork. This is something that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have suffered since they were created. People who hold XTZ can vote on proposals for protocol upgrades that have been put forward by Tezos developers. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Tezos . This open-source platform bills itself as “secure, upgradable and built to last” — and says its smart contract language provides the accuracy that is required for high-value use cases. According to Tezos, its approach means that it is futureproof and will “remain state-of-the-art long into the future,” meaning it can embrace developments in blockchain technology. The technology underpinning Tezos was first proposed in a white paper that was released in September 2014. After a series of delays, the Tezos mainnet launched four years later. Who Are the Founders of Tezos? Arthur Breitman was the man who wrote the Tezos white paper — and in a nod to  Satoshi Nakamoto , he wrote his works under the pen name L. M. Goodman. He argued that one of Bitcoin’s biggest failings was the lack of a governance process that invited contributions from the community who use the network — as well as the fact that new tokens couldn’t be issued through this blockchain. He and his wife Kathleen founded a startup called Dynamic Ledger Solutions which was tasked with writing the code that would underpin the Tezos protocol. This company was subsequently purchased by the Tezos Foundation to ensure that it owned all of the intellectual property rights relating to the network. What Makes Tezos Unique? Although staking is common across blockchains, Tezos has a unique twist on this process. Participants can get involved with the network’s governance through “baking,” where they effectively stake 8,000 XTZ. This creates a financial incentive to act honestly. Bakers are then tasked with voting on proposed changes to the blockchain’s code in a four-step procedure that takes approximately 23 days. Proposals that receive support from the vast majority of participants are put through their paces on a testnet for 48 hours and are fully implemented if they are backed by a super-majority. Tezos is also unique because of how it has started to be used by high-profile businesses. In September 2020, it was announced that the French banking giant Societe Generale planned to use this blockchain for experimenting with a central bank digital currency. Big cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have also unveiled support for Tezos staking, meaning users can receive rewards based on the XTZ that they hold. This is not a feature that’s seen too widely across digital assets. Related Pages : Read in-depth tech deep dives on CMC Alexandria Glossary: What is staking? Discover which cryptos have recently been added to CMC CoinMarketCap Blog: The latest features and analysis A Deep Dive Into Tezos How Many Tezos (XTZ) Coins Are There in Circulation? Our data shows that 743,862,304 XTZ are in circulation at the time of writing. A token sale for Tezos was held back in July 2017 — and during this ICO, a total of 65,681 BTC and 361,122 ETH was raised. At the time, this was worth $232 million, securing its place as one of the largest initial coin offerings ever held. While 80% of this initial supply went to investors, 20% was split equally between the Tezos Foundation and Dynamic Ledger Solutions. The mainnet’s launch was delayed by a series of lawsuits from some disgruntled investors, who argued that XTZ amounted to unregistered securities. How Is the Tezos Network Secured? Like other blockchains, Tezos uses a  proof-of-stake  consensus mechanism. Anyone can become a validator and contribute to the smooth running of the network by making a security deposit. To incentivize honest behavior, rewards are given to those who work in the best interests of the blockchain — and those who act dishonestly risk losing their stake altogether. Where Can You Buy Tezos (XTZ)? XTZ, otherwise known as “tez” for short, can be purchased from most major exchanges — including Binance, Coinbase and others. Trading pairs unite XTZ with fiat currencies, as well as other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.  If you’re looking to convert fiat into Bitcoin, you can read a comprehensive guide here.

  "content": "What Is Terra (LUNA)? Terra is a  blockchain  protocol that uses fiat-pegged  stablecoins  to power price-stable global payments systems. According to its white paper, Terra  combines  the price stability and wide adoption of fiat currencies with the censorship-resistance of  Bitcoin  (BTC) and offers fast and affordable settlements. Development on Terra began in January 2018, and its mainnet officially  launched  in April 2019. As of September 2021, it  offers  stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik and the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies — and it intends to roll out additional options. Terra's native token, LUNA, is used to stabilize the price of the protocol's stablecoins. LUNA holders are also able to submit and vote on governance proposals, giving it the functionality of a  governance token . Who Are the Founders of Terra? Terra was founded in January 2018 by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon. The two  conceived  of the project as a way to drive the rapid adoption of blockchain technology and  cryptocurrency  through a focus on price stability and usability. Kwon took on the position of CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra. Prior to developing Terra, Shin  co-founded  and headed Ticket Monster, otherwise known as TMON — a major South Korean e-commerce platform. He later  co-founded  Fast Track Asia, a startup incubator working with entrepreneurs to build fully functional companies. Kwon previously founded and served as CEO of Anyfi, a startup providing decentralized wireless mesh networking solutions. He has also worked as a software engineer for Microsoft and Apple. What Makes Terra Unique? Terra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand. Terra has established a number of partnerships with payments platforms, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In July 2019, Terra  announced  a partnership with Chai, a South Korea-based mobile payments application, in which purchases made using the application on e-commerce platforms are processed via the Terra blockchain network. Each transaction is subject to (on average) a 2%–3% fee charged to the merchant. In addition, Terra is supported by the Terra Alliance, a group of businesses and platforms advocating for the adoption of Terra. In February 2019, the company  announced  that e-commerce platforms from 10 different countries, representing a user base of 45 million and a gross merchandise value of $25 billion, were members of the alliance.

Stay up to date on the ways stablecoins are changing the payments industry with the CoinMarketCap education portal —  Alexandria . How Many Terra (LUNA) Coins Are There in Circulation? Terra has a supply of 1 billion tokens. If this number is exceeded, LUNA is burned until it returns to the equilibrium supply level. New LUNA tokens are minted through the protocol's algorithm, as needed, in order to maintain the price of Terra stablecoins. LUNA was first made available for purchase in a private token sale for initial investors, which included the investment arms of major exchanges such as  Binance ,  OKEx  and  Huobi . The sale concluded in August 2018, and as a result, Terra  raised  $32 million. Of the 385,245,974 LUNA minted for the sale, 10% was  reserved  for Terraform Labs, 20% for employees and project contributors, 20% for the Terra Alliance, 20% for price stability reserves, 26% for project backers and 4% for genesis liquidity. How Is the Terra Network Secured? The Terra blockchain is secured using a  proof-of-stake   consensus  algorithm based on Tendermint, in which LUNA token holders  stake  their tokens as collateral to validate transactions, receiving rewards in proportion to the amount of LUNA staked. Tokenholders may also delegate others to validate transactions on their behalf, sharing in any revenue generated. Terra also  offers  additional guidance to validator nodes on the best practices for helping to keep the network secure. In May 2019, shortly after Terra's mainnet went live, blockchain verification and penetration testing firm CertiK  completed  a security audit of the network. It examined its economic model to test against market manipulation, its architecture and its coding language. CertiK found that the \"modeling and mathematical reasoning\" of the Terra network were \"considered sound,\" although it would not comment on the blockchain's performance. Where Can You Buy Terra (LUNA)? Terra's native token, LUNA, is listed on several cryptocurrency exchanges — including  Huobi ,  Bitfinex  and  Upbit  — where it is available to be traded against fiat currencies, stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. Are you interested in buying LUNA or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin? CoinMarketCap has an educational section —  Alexandria  — to teach you all about crypto and how to buy your first coins.

Quant is down 0.26% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #54, with a live market cap of $3,305,987,851 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 12,072,738 QNT coins   and a max. supply of 14,612,493 QNT coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Quant , the top exchanges for trading in  Quant  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   Coinbase Exchange ,   KuCoin ,    and   Gate.io .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Quant (QNT)? Quant launched in June 2018 with the goal of connecting blockchains and networks on a global scale, without reducing the efficiency and interoperability of the network. It is the first project to solve the interoperability problem through the creation of the first blockchain operating system. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Quant . The project is built as an operating system distributed ledger technology— and Overledger Network — for connecting different blockchain networks. The project is billed as the first OS to be built for blockchains. The main aim of Quant — using Overledger — is to bridge the gap that exists between different blockchains. The backbone of the project is the Overledger network, which Quant bills as the ecosystem on which the future digital economy ecosystem will be built.  Overledger allows developers to build decentralized multi-chain applications (known as MApps) for their customers. For developers to build a Mapp on the network, they must hold a certain amount of Quant tokens (QNT). Who Are the Founders of Quant? Gilbert Verdian, one of the founders of the Quant network, had the idea for the blockchain project while he was working in the healthcare sector. Verdian identified the importance of interoperability in ensuring that patients registered on different platforms are covered. Verdian has over 20 years of industry experience in upgrading the security, technology and business strategies of businesses around the globe in order to achieve tangible results.  Prior to the Quant Network, Verdian served as the chief information security officer (CISO) of Vocalink, a Mastercard card company, the chief information officer of NSW Ambulance, the CISO of eHealth NSW, and the security lead of the Ministry of Justice, UK. The second co-founder, Dr Paolo Tasca, is an entrepreneur, digital economist who specializes in distributed systems. Dr. Tasca has served as the special advisor on blockchain technologies for the EU Parliament, the United Nations and numerous central banks worldwide. He is also co-author of several books on fintech and is the co-founder and governing board chair of Retail Blockchain Consortium. What Makes Quant Unique? Since the introduction of blockchain and the distributed ledger technology, innovators have found use cases in almost every known industry. However, there has been the problem of seamless interoperability between these projects. Quant was created to be the missing link between the “different” blockchains. Quant’s operating system, Overledger, was designed to act as a gateway for any blockchain-based project to access all other blockchains. It also works in connecting an application to other applications in the same blockchain ecosystem, like Ethereum. More than multiple blockchain interactions, Quant creates different layers for apps to interact at different levels. Quant has different layers for transactions, messaging, filtering and ordering, and an application for sharing and referencing identical messages related to other applications. The Quant App Store has the ability to read and monitor transactions across multiple ledgers. Using Overledger, developers write smart contracts across a wide variety of chains including those that don’t support them — such as Bitcoin. Developers can also use the store to create and release multi-chain applications (MApps). Related Pages: Find out about  Chainlink (LINK) . Find out about  Polkadot (DOT) . Learn how to use  Uniswap . Read up to date crypto news on the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Quant (QNT) Tokens Are There in Circulation? Enterprises do not need to purchase the QNT tokens in order to use the Quant Network. However, they need the QNT tokens to use the network.  A developer has to purchase a license (in QNT) to create anything on the platform. This requires tokens to be locked up for 12 months. The cost of running the Gateways and performing read/write operations on Overledger requires the use of the QNT tokens. The max supply of QNT tokens is set at 14,612,493 tokens. The QNT tokens were split in the following way: 9.9 million QNT tokens were sold to the public during the ICO; 2.6 million QNT tokens were assigned to the company reserve, to keep the project running; 1.3 million QNT tokens were reserved for the company founders; 651,000 QNT tokens were issued to the company advisors. Currently, the circulating supply of the token is 12,072,738 QNT. The extra 2 million tokens are held by the company. These tokens are unlocked and could be sold or issued at any time. How Is Quant Secured? Overledger forms the backbone of the Quant Network. Overledger ensures communicability among DLT networks and interacts with different blockchains. The Overledger Network includes gateways for linking different blockchains. Similar to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchains, the Quant Network community is involved in handling treasury smart contracts. The community handles QNT payments flowing from users to the gateways. They do this in a manner where people are held accountable to any observer. Where Can You Buy Quant (QNT)? Quant tokens can be purchased, sold, and traded on several exchanges, including; Bilaxy Bittrex Bithumb Global 1inch Exchange Uniswap (V2) , and Hotbit .  QNT can be traded against  cryptocurrencies  such as  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Ether  (ETH),  stablecoins  such as  Tether  (USDT), and fiat currencies such as the euro.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is SKALE Network (SKL)?  SKALE is described as an elastic network that’s designed to bring scalability to  Ethereum . As well as boosting transaction capacity, the decentralized project aims to reduce latency and ensure that payments can be made as cheaply as possible. The project’s website says it wants to enable people to build and run  DApps  in a “decentralized modular cloud built for real-world needs and configured for your requirements.” This emphasis on decentralization isn’t at the expense of security. According to SKALE, those who build on this platform can run Solidity smart contracts “thousands of times faster at a fraction of the mainnet cost” — with games and content streaming services among the projects that already take advantage of its infrastructure.  Who Are the Founders of SKALE Network? SKALE Network was founded by Jack O’Holleran and Stan Kladko, both of whom have vast experience across the software industry.  O’Holleran — the co-founder and chief executive of SKALE — is a technology entrepreneur who specializes in blockchain and decentralized systems. He continues to hold a strategic advisor role at Aktana, the life sciences company he co-founded in 2008. According to his LinkedIn profile, O’Holleran began the early stages of his career as an account executive at Good Technology. He spent two years there before joining Motorola’s business development and product strategy division.  Kladko spent many years obtaining a PhD in physics prior to co-founding SKALE, and worked for 16 years as a technology executive in San Francisco’s Silicon Valley.  He has co-founded several other companies, including Galactic Exchange and Cloudessa. What Makes SKALE Network Unique? SKALE Network is geared towards improving both security and decentralization of Ethereum-based apps.  Token holders on the SKALE Network are incentivized and earn rewards by helping to improve the scalability and security of the platform by serving as validators. The SKALE Network was the first project to launch a token on ConsenSys Codefi’s Activate platform — which is “designed to launch decentralized networks and allow customers to purchase, manage and use their tokens — all in one application.” Activate was designed to create new standards for the distribution of utility tokens, and ensure that networks are fully usable as soon as tokens are sold. It’s hoped that this approach will help clean up the appearance of the initial coin offering sector, which has been susceptible to scams in recent years. By launching a token that meets regulatory standards, SKALE is intending its token to be widely adopted and avoid any fraudulent activity.  Ethereum is typically slow to verify and authorize transactions. Using SKALE Network greatly improves the speed at which Ethereum verifies transactions as SKALE can operate much faster and run up to a maximum of 2,000 transactions per second per chain, according to the team.

The total supply of SKL tokens at the launch of the SKALE Network was 4.1 billion. When it comes to the maximum supply, this figure is fixed at 7 billion tokens. According to a white paper released by the SKALE Network in July 2020, one third (33%) was allocated to validator rewards, 28.1% was earmarked for delegators, 16% was allocated to the broader founding team, 10% to the SKALE Foundation, 7.7% to the protocol development fund, 4% to the core team pool and 1.3% to the ecosystem fund.  How Is the SKALE Network Secured? Validators in the SKALE Network secure the network by proposing blocks. Once the validators come to a consensus on a finalized block, the blocks are committed to the chain.  The SKALE Network uses  proof-of-stake  (PoS) to ensure the network is secured.

NuCypher is up 1.80% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #132, with a live market cap of $637,374,339 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 687,500,000 NU coins   and a max. supply of 3,885,390,082 NU coins. If you would like to know where to buy  NuCypher , the top exchanges for trading in  NuCypher  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   Huobi Global ,    and   Upbit .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is NuCypher (NU)? NuCypher is a decentralized encryption, access control and key management system (KMS), encryption service for public  blockchains . NuCypher offers end-to-end encrypted data sharing on public blockchains and decentralized storage solutions. NuCypher allows users to share private data between a number of participants in public consensus networks, using proxy re-encryption (PRE) technology. This decryption technology makes NuCypher much more secure and protected than traditional blockchain projects based on public-key encryption, according to NuCypher.  NuCypher (NU) are the native tokens used on the larger NuCypher network. The tokens are used to incentivize network participants for performing key management services and accessing delegation/revocation operations on the network. The NU tokens are also used for staking to run a NuCypher worker node. The NuCypher network is protected against malicious staking, and would automatically slash a suspected user’s rewards.  NU is also used on the network for participating in the NuCypher DAO. The NuCypher DAO is the protocol that controls network parameters and smart contract upgrades on the network. Users who stake NU can also participate in validating DAO proposals. Who Are the Founders of NuCypher? NuCypher was co-founded by Mikhail Egorov (the founder of Curve) and MacLane Wilkison. The white paper for NuCypher was first published in June 2017, but the testnet did not launch until November 2018. Egorov formerly served as the CTO of NuCypher. He is a security researcher, physicist and scientist from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Co-founder MacLane is a software engineer and the CEO of NuCypher. Prior to his involvement in blockchain, he worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley, where he provided financial services to enterprises in technology, media and telecommunications. Both Egorov and MacLane participated in the U.S. startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2016. The following year, the whitepaper for the NuCypher project was published. NuCypher launched its private testnet in 2018. The private treatment launch saw participation from major staking infrastructure providers including Bison Trails, Figment, InfStones and Staked.us.  The public testnet of NuCypher began in October 2019. However, the incentivized public testnet began in January 2020. The mainnet of NuCypher launched in October 2020 after distributing $45 million in NU tokens to nodes. What Makes NuCypher Unique? Unlike most blockchain projects that are designed to serve customers, better transactions, IoT operations, voting mechanism, and the like, NuCypher was created for other blockchains. NuCypher is a privacy layer for blockchains. NuCypher provides a privacy infrastructure for the decentralized web with proxy re-encryption (PRE), threshold signatures (TSS), distributed key generation (DKG), and other threshold cryptography. Using the NuCypher network, users can conditionally grant and revoke access to data with multiple users at a time. NuCypher's encryption service provides almost unparalleled security for sensitive data transfer. It combines this with the trustless and censorship-resistant nature of conventional public blockchains. The cryptographic libraries of NuCypher include; pyUmbral , the reference implementation of the Umbral threshold proxy re-encryption scheme; NuBLS , a threshold BLS signature library, and rust-umbral , a Rust implementation of Umbral with bindings to JavaScript and Python. How Many NuCypher (NU) Tokens Are There in Circulation? At NuCypher’s mainnet launch in October 2020, there was a total supply of 1 billion NU tokens. According to the release schedule, 3,335,938 and 4,460,000 NU tokens are released monthly to the SAFT Series 2 and Team/Equity investors every month. The WorkLock, NuCypher’s novel network node setup mechanism, is expected to get 225,000,000 NU tokens in April 2021. Factoring in the monthly release of the NU tokens, 1,088,876,961 NU tokens have been issued with 392,750,000 currently in circulation. The network has a max supply of ~3.89 billion NU tokens. The tokens are released monthly as rewards to stakers, according to the  staking economics paper . How Is the NuCypher Network Secured? NuCypher is a layer 2 resource allocation protocol on Ethereum that uses a  proof-of-stake  (PoS) mechanism to coordinate worker nodes. The network runs on a novel node distribution mechanism which NuCypher calls the WorkLock. To run a NuCypher node, a minimum of 2,000 node operators would need to stake 353,913. The minimum lockup staking period is 30 days. However, NuCypher doesn’t guarantee that staking for longer than one year will provide greater benefits in terms of earning rewards. Unless the user opts out after a staking period, staking rewards are automatically restaked after each period. Where Can You Buy Nucypher (NU)? NuCypher (NU) is popular among online exchanges that trade ethereum tokens. The top exchanges where you can buy, sell, and trade NuCypher tokens currently are:  Coinbase Pro Binance UniSwap Huobi Hoo OKEx Gate.io Hotbit , and 1inch Exchange If you are new, you can find our simplified guide for purchasing crypto and more exchanges where you can trade  here .

  "content": "STX Price Live Data The live  Stacks price today  is $1.99 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $124,073,798 USD.   We update our STX to USD price in real-time.   Stacks is up 1.78% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #64, with a live market cap of $2,552,879,283 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 1,281,856,720 STX coins   and a max. supply of 1,818,000,000 STX coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Stacks , the top exchanges for trading in  Stacks  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   FTX ,    and   Upbit .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Stacks (STX)? Stacks is a layer-1 blockchain solution that is designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications ( DApps ) to  Bitcoin (BTC) . These smart contracts are brought to Bitcoin without changing any of the features that make it so powerful — including its security and stability.  These DApps are open and modular, meaning developers can build on top of each other's apps to produce features that are simply not possible in a regular app. Since Stacks uses Bitcoin as a base layer, everything that happens on the network is settled on the most widely used arguably the most secure  blockchain  in operation — Bitcoin.  The platform is powered by the Stacks token (STX), which is used for fueling the execution of smart contracts, processing transactions and registering new digital assets on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.  The platform was formerly known as Blockstack, but was rebranded to Stacks in Q4 2020 in order to \"separate the ecosystem and open source project from Blockstack PBC\" — the company that built the original protocols. The mainnet for Stacks 2.0 launched in January 2021. Who Are the Founders of Stacks? Stacks was initially funded by a range of prominent venture capital funds, including Y Combinator, Digital Currency Group and Winklevoss Capital. It was developed by Blockstack PBC, which has its headquarters in New York.  Blockstack PBC now operates under the name Hiro Systems PBC and joins a wide range of companies building on Stacks' platform. Blockstack PBC was founded by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea. After graduating from Princeton University with an MA and PhD in computer science, Muneeb Ali co-founded Stacks in 2013, and still works with the platform today as the CEO of Hiro Systems PBC.  The second co-founder of the platform, Ryan Shea, also served co-CEO between 2013 and 2018, before disembarking from the project to pursue other ventures — including co-founding a new tech startup that is currently operating in stealth. Prior to his role at Stacks, Shea worked as a software engineer.  What Makes Stacks Unique? Stacks looks to take what makes Bitcoin so powerful, and extends it with additional functionality, without needing to fork or change the original Bitcoin blockchain.  It does this by connecting directly with the Bitcoin blockchain through its proof-of-transfer (PoX)  consensus mechanism , which has miners pay in BTC to mint new Stacks (STX) tokens. Moreover, STX token holders can also stack ( not  stake ) their tokens to earn Bitcoin as a reward.  Stacks introduces a new smart contract programming language known as Clarity, which is designed to be both secure and easy to build with thanks to its unambiguous syntax. This smart contract-centric programming language is also used by the  Algorand (ALGO)  blockchain.  On top of this, Stacks was the first cryptocurrency to receive SEC qualification for a sale in the United States, allowing it to launch a $28 million Reg A+ sale cash offering for its STX tokens in July 2019.

How Many Stacks (STX) Coins Are There in Circulation? According to the recently revamped economic policy launched with Stacks 2.0, the supply of the newly unlocked STX in circulation will be reduced by around 10% between now and 2020 compared to the original schedule.  In total, around 1.82 billion STX are expected to be in circulation by 2050, compared to around 739.7 million in circulation as of January 2021. As per the  Stacks 2.0 whitepaper draft (v0.1) , a total of 1,000 STX per block will be released in the first four years, decreasing to 500 STX/block in the subsequent 4 years, 250 STX/block in the next four years, and then 125 STX/block after that in perpetuity. In total, 6.6% of the initial genesis supply (1.32 billion STX) was allocated to the founder and a further 7.9% to the Stacks team. These are subject to a three year unlock schedule, with tokens next scheduled to unlock in November 2021. How Is the Stacks Network Secured? Stacks uses the Bitcoin blockchain as its base layer. As a  Proof of Work (PoW) -based blockchain, Bitcoin uses the combined efforts of thousands of miners and nodes to protect the network against  attacks  by making it computationally and economically unfeasible to subvert the network.  On top of this, Stacks introduces its own consensus model, known as proof-of-transfer (PoX), which is a novel mining mechanism that sees users transfer the base currency (BTC) to mine STX — effectively bootstrapping the security of the Stacks blockchain using BTC.  Where Can You Buy Stacks (STX)? STX is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including  Binance  and KuCoin.

Reef is up 3.10% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #147, with a live market cap of $533,982,060 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 14,807,552,172 REEF coins   and a max. supply of 20,000,000,000 REEF coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Reef , the top exchanges for trading in  Reef  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   CoinTiger ,   FTX ,    and   Huobi Global .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Reef (REEF)? Reef is a  DeFi  platform built on  Polkadot  that aims to deliver cross-chain trading. A yield engine and a smart liquidity aggregator are among the project’s offerings. Work began on the project in the second half of 2020. Those behind Reef argue that the process of trading, lending and staking crypto is currently fragmented — creating “a painful experience for all of its participants.” Reef aggregates liquidity and provides automation. It also aims to address the drawbacks associated with existing trading platforms. While centralized exchanges are prone to security breaches, decentralized rivals can lack liquidity and are often difficult to use. Who Are the Founders of Reef? Reef was founded by Denko Mancheski. His motivation was to remove technical barriers to entry for retail investors who want to get involved with DeFi — and offer a straightforward decision-making process that takes a user’s appetite for risk into account. Mancheski wanted to help crypto newcomers overcome the complexities associated with using order books, and enable them to learn how different protocols work with ease. Born in Macedonia, Mancheski said that his passion for fintech led to him being introduced to blockchain technology. He has described forming a competent team as the biggest challenge associated with bringing Reef to life.  When asked about the personal attributes that will help him become a successful entrepreneur, he added: “I have a very addictive personality — I just can’t stop doing something until I get to the imaginary goal that I set for myself.” Mancheski previously worked as a chief technology officer for Adel, a global crypto community that serves as a “technology incubator for blockchain innovation.” He was also appointed as CTO for Viewly, a social video platform without advertisements. What Makes Reef Unique? Reef is geared towards newcomers, as well as current DeFi users who find it difficult to keep up with the best investment strategies. The company also wants to tackle the high gas fees that are seen on the  Ethereum  blockchain, which some claim renders DeFi protocols “unusable.” When it comes to Reef’s unique attributes, one is linked to how any DeFi protocol can integrate into its operating system. Users can enter and exit into their chosen positions in a single click — and removes some of the hassle associated with managing liquidity pool tokens. Because of how it has been built on Polkadot, Reef is able to support DeFi protocols on Avalanche, Moonbeam and Plasma, as well as on Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain. As a result, Reef users have access to a broader number of platforms without requiring multiple accounts and a myriad of usernames and passwords that can be difficult to keep track of.

Subscribe to the  CoinMarketCap newsletter . How Many Reef (REEF) Coins Are There in Circulation? At present, REEF has a circulating supply of above three billion tokens. When it comes to the total token supply, approximately 3% has been allocated to Binance Launchpool, while 21% has been distributed to investors through token sales. The Reef team holds 16% of the supply and a specially created foundation has 17.5%, with about 12.5% earmarked for developing the ecosystem. The remaining 30% is devoted to protocol emissions and liquidity rewards, and tokens are going to be gradually released between now and the end of 2025. How Is the Reef Network Secured? According to Reef, the network is secured under the shared security model operated by Polkadot. Not only does this make the network resilient, but it also means that upgrades can be performed without forks. A decentralized autonomous organization has also been established that is governed by those who hold REEF tokens. Where Can You Buy Reef (REEF)? REEF is available on  Binance  in two trading pairs — linking this token with  Bitcoin  and the  USDT  stablecoin. It has also been listed on Bilaxy. REEF can also be acquired through the decentralized  Uniswap  exchange using Wrapped Ether and USDT.  Read more about how to convert fiat currencies to crypto here.

Band Protocol is up 0.62% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #171, with a live market cap of $348,755,357 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 35,191,821 BAND coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Band Protocol , the top exchanges for trading in  Band Protocol  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Band Protocol (BAND)? Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that is able to take real-world data and supply it to on-chain applications, while also connecting APIs to smart-contracts to facilitate the exchange of information between on-chain and off-chain data sources.  By supplying reputable, verifiable real-world data to  blockchains , Band Protocol unlocks a range of new use cases for developers to explore — since they can now use any type of real-world data as part of their  decentralized application (DApp)  logic, including sports, weather, random numbers, price feed data and more. Band Protocol initially launched as an  ERC-20  project on the Ethereum blockchain in September 2019, but transitioned to the Cosmos network in June 2020 with the release of Band Protocol 2.0. The new protocol is built on BandChain using the Cosmos SDK. Oracle nodes on BandChain not only relay data but are also involved in block production/validation, giving them a dual role. BAND is the native token of the Band Protocol ecosystem and is used as collateral by validators involved in fulfilling data requests, as well as the main medium of exchange on BandChain — being used to paying for private data. Who Are the Founders of Band Protocol? Band Protocol was founded in 2017 by Soravis Srinawakoon, Paul Chonpimai and Sorawit Suriyakarn.  Soravis Srinawakoon, the current CEO of Band Protocol, is a former software engineer at Ericsson and management consultant at The Boston Consulting Group. Paul Chonpimai, on the other hand, is Band Protocol's CPO, and a former web developer at Turfmapp and engineer at Tripadvisor. Lastly, former software engineer at Dropbox and Quora Sorawit Suriyakarn is Band Protocol's current CTO and a gold medalist competitive programmer. In addition to the founding team, the Band Protocol LinkedIn page currently lists a total of 20 additional employees, most of which are scattered throughout Asia, and include designers, developers and engineers. The platform is also supported by major global investors, including Sequoia Capital, Dunamu & Partners, Spartan Group and  Binance . What Makes Band Protocol Unique? Band Protocol is designed to be faster and more efficient than competing oracle solutions and is also compatible with most blockchain and  smart contract  development frameworks — ensuring reliable data can be fed to and from multiple different blockchains.  To achieve its cross-chain data transfer, Band Protocol plans to leverage Cosmos' still in-development Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It remains unclear how long it will take until the IBC is operational and ready for use. Band Protocol is designed to offer permissionless oracle creation, allowing anybody to start servicing data requests. It also offers extremely simple smart contract integration, allowing developers to begin using data from Band Protocol oracles with just a few lines of code by calling on a predefined interface.

How Many Band Protocol (BAND) Coins Are There in Circulation? Band Protocol originally released the BAND token following an  initial exchange offering (IEO)  on the Binance Launchpad in September 2019. A total of 27.37% of the total supply was sold across three token sale rounds (seed, private, and public sale). The total supply of BAND is capped at 100 million tokens. Of this, just over 20% (20.49 million tokens) were in circulation as of November 2020.  Overall, a total of 20% of the BAND token supply is allocated to the team, plus a further 5% to its advisors. 25.63% is allocated to the Band Protocol ecosystem. Based on the projected emission rate, a total of 100% of the total supply should be in circulation by 2025 at the earliest How Is the Band Protocol Network Secured? Though BAND tokens were previously based on the ERC-20 standard, they were recently relaunched as native BAND tokens on the Band Protocol mainnet (known as BandChain).  Holders of the older tokens are able to complete a 1:1 swap by depositing their  ERC-20  BAND tokens to Binance, and then withdrawing them as native tokens. This will be necessary to participate in BAND staking — which is only available for mainnet tokens.  Based on the Cosmos' SDK, BandChain is secured by a Byzantine fault Tolerance (BFT)  consensus  algorithm, which protects it against  attacks . This works in combination with a delegated proof of stake (dPOS) setup, which secures the network’s oracles and allows BAND holders to earn staking rewards for delegating their stake to nodes.  Where Can You Buy Band Protocol (BAND)? BAND was first tracked on public exchanges by CoinMarketCap in September 2019. Since then, it has been listed on a wide range of platforms, including several tier 1 exchanges — like Binance,  Coinbase Pro  and  OKEx .  The vast majority of BAND trading pairs are against  Tether (USDT)  and  Bitcoin (BTC) , but BAND can also be traded against several fiat currencies, including GBP, USD and EUR on Coinbase Pro.

Polkastarter is up 1.90% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #281, with a live market cap of $250,916,905 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 81,301,332 POLS coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Polkastarter , the top exchanges for trading in  Polkastarter  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   Huobi Global ,    and   KuCoin .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Polkastarter (POLS)? Polkastarter is a  blockchain  platform designed to provide an easy to use launchpad for cross-chain token pools and auctions. It is most commonly used by early-stage blockchain projects that want to raise capital and easily distribute their tokens at the same time.  Through Polkastarter, blockchain projects can easily create their own cross-chain swap pools, which allow them to securely raise funds, while users can invest without risks, since swaps are automatically executed by  smart contracts .  POLS is the native utility token of the Polkastarter platform and plays a number of roles in its ecosystem, being used for liquidity mining, governance, paying transaction fees, and gaining eligibility to participate in POLS-holder only pools.  The platform first went live in December 2020, and has quickly grown to become one of the most commonly used platforms for initial DEX offerings (IDOs). As of February 2021, Polkastarter operates on the Ethereum blockchain, but will eventually migrate to the Polkadot mainnet.  Who Are the Founders of Polkastarter? Polkastarter features an executive team with over three decades of combined experience in tech firms. It was co-founded by Daniel Stockhaus and Tiago Martins, who currently hold the roles of CEO and CTO at Polkastarter respectively. Daniel Stockhaus is a serial entrepreneur credited with co-founding a highly successful e-commerce firm known as LiGo, as well as the digital growth agency Oliphant Ltd. Prior to this, he worked as a digital media designer for Fitch, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in communication and media studies. Tiago Martins, on the other hand, is a former professor of computer science and an experienced developer with expertise in online education and product development. He is also the co-founder of Codeplace, an online platform that teaches the fundamentals of web development. Besides the executive members, the Polkastarter team also includes several heavily experienced advisors and other non-public staff.  What Makes Polkastarter Unique? Polkastarter's main offering is its fixed swap smart contract, which allows projects to easily launch  liquidity pools  that execute orders at a fixed price — rather than using the  AMM  model made popular by  Uniswap .  The platform is designed to handle a range of auction types, including sealed-bid and dutch auctions, as well as both fixed and dynamic ratio swaps. This makes it suitable for cryptocurrency projects looking to raise funds, as well as a variety of other use-cases, including private trades, OTC deals, and discounted sales.  Beyond this, other key features of the platform include permissionless listings, anti-scam capabilities, full KYC integration and liquidity mining.  It should be noted that many of these features are currently unavailable, but are scheduled to launch at a later date — possibly after Polkastarter transitions to the Polkadot network, which is currently slated for Q1 2021.

How Many Polkastarter (POLS) Coins Are There in Circulation? As of February 2021, a total of 56.5 million POLS are in free circulation, out of a total supply of 100 million tokens. POLS initially launched with 17.875 million tokens in circulation, but this has since increased to its current levels due to the gradual release of locked tokens. According to the  official tokenomics , POLS should reach 100% dilution 24 months after listing (approximately late September 2022).  Overall, the total supply is divided as follows: Foundation reserve: 10% Team & Advisors: 10% Marketing fund: 10% Liquidity fund: 22.5% Seed sale: 15% Private sale: 22.5% Team tokens are locked for 1 year and are then unlocked at a rate of 25% per quarter.  How Is the Polkastarter Network Secured? As of March 2021, Polkastarter is based on the  Ethereum  blockchain and POLS is an  ERC-20  token. As a result, it is secured by Ethereum’s extensive  proof-of-work  (PoW) mining system, which sees thousands of miners and nodes work together to keep the network secure.  In Q1 2021, Polkastarter is scheduled to migrate to Polkadot. This move will be facilitated through its partnership with Moonbeam, which will allow the Polkastarter team to easily port its current Ethereum-facing code to Polkadot. Once launched on Polkadot, transactions will instead be secured by Polkadot’s hybrid  consensus  mechanism — consisting of GRANDPA and BABE. BABE is used to propose block producers, whereas GRANDPA finalizes them. The two systems work together to prevent centralization and protect against Sybil attacks.  Where Can You Buy Polkastarter (POLS)? Despite being a relatively new token, POLS can be traded on a large number of prominent cryptocurrency exchanges — some of the most popular of which include  Huobi Global , Gate.io and Poloniex. It's also available on most major decentralized exchanges — including  Uniswap ,  1inch  and 0x Protocol.  The most liquid trading pairs for the cryptocurrency are POLS/WETH and POLS/USDT. There are currently no direct fiat to POLS trading pairs available — but you may be able to  buy BTC with fiat  first, and then exchange this to POLS.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is LTO Network (LTO)? LTO Network is a hybrid blockchain platform for decentralized workflows and business process automatization. Thanks to a solution based on live contracts, companies can enter into and carry out transactions, exchange information with each other, organize supply chains, delegate data processing and more, simultaneously and without relying on trust. LTO Network, formerly known as LegalThings One, was established in May 2014 as a subsidiary of Firm24. For several years the main goal of the project has been to implement simple legal transactions on the blockchain. Conceptually, it is based on the interaction between private and public blockchains. LTO Network provides the following kinds of assistance: the facilitation and control of the entire transaction process, the exchange of information between parties, the creation of business supply chains and the secure transfer of data to third parties. By removing the need to depend on the human factor in business transactions, LTO Network is expected to allow companies to focus on improving the efficiency, transparency and security of their business. Who Are the Founders of LTO Network? Firm24 initially began developing LTO Network as LegalThings One in 2014. In 2017, it decided to add blockchain to the product and rebrand it to LTO Network.  Rick Schmitz is the CEO and co-founder of LTO Network. Prior to that, he worked in private equity and mergers and acquisitions at Deloitte and PwC.  Martijn Migchelsen is the CFO, COO and co-founder of LTO Network. Previously, he worked as a corporate finance consultant at PwC. Arnold Daniels is another co-founder and lead architect of the project. Before LTO Network, Daniels worked as a lead software engineer at Cloud9. Sven Stam is the CTO of LTO Network. He has a master's degree in artificial intelligence and has been in the industry for 15 years, joining LTO in 2015. The advisory group consists of Mike Egorov (founder and CTO at NuCypher), Sandor Klein (VP of sales at Docker), Femke Stroucken (legal consultant at CMS) and Pedro Irujo (Cemex Ventures).  What Makes LTO Network (LTO) Unique? The two key features of LTO Network are easy-to-use live contracts and the implementation of the hybrid blockchain mechanism with anchorage. The live contracts allow parties to create mutually beneficial agreements in real-time. When the parties come to an agreement and launch a live contract, the LTO parent system creates a special private blockchain in order to record the history of events and the contract’s current state. When the agreement is fulfilled, one of the parties sends a response to the blockchain, and the other signs it, allowing the node to confirm that the action has taken place. All contract data is available only to its parties. Live contracts allow users to register actions, add/remove participants and record discussions on the blockchain. They also make it possible to resolve conflicts and insert sub-processes within the framework of an existing agreement. The blockchain functionality is divided into two layers: public and private. The private layer is designed for efficient collaboration, data exchange and process automation. In turn, the public layer provides high-level security, thanks to distributed nodes and a reward system. Related Pages: Read about  Stellar . Read about  Ethereum .

There are four types of token holders: integrators and partners who keep the network operational and receive project coins as a reward; clients who use live contracts for transactions; passive stakers — private users who provide their technical capabilities to confirm transactions on the blockchain; inactive holders who are not part of the community and invest in the token for the purpose of future earnings. How Is the LTO Network Secured? The LTO Network is fully compliant with the European Union’s GDPR data protection law. The hybrid LTO framework allows private blockchains to be as scalable as possible while still having the security characteristics of the already widespread public blockchains. LTO Network is secured by the proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus algorithm. Where Can You Buy LTO Network (LTO)?

The team released the first Beta version this year and acquired a UK Gambling Operating License. Currently available on  Ethereum ,  BSC  and  Polygon , it plans to launch on Polkadot in the future and launch a V1.0 of its XED  decentralized exchange .  Who Are the Founders of Exeedme? The Exeedme team brands itself as a “seasoned team with entrepreneurial experience and make it happen attitude.” The project was launched by CEO Nuno Fernandes and CSO Francisco Varela. Nuno Fernandes is an experienced dealmaker with €1B+ closings and a former manager of the mergers and acquisitions teams of PwC and KPMG. Francisco Varela is a serial entrepreneur with five successful ventures launched and scaled to $10m+ and the first exclusive gaming gear marketplace founder. The team is complemented by advisors Guilherme Almedia (tech development), Rui Teixeira (blockchain gaming), and Nuno Correia (blockchain payments). Ricardo Pacheco, a professional Counter-Strike:GO player, is the project’s ambassador.  What Makes Exeedme Unique? The Exeedme team realized that making money playing video games is very hard except for a selected few professionals. However, becoming a professional requires a lot of time to build up the skill and comes with huge competition and high barriers to entry. Moreover, traditional games are characterized by aggressive in-game purchasing strategies and siloed game assets that don’t allow players to monetize their in-game assets. Exeedme expands beyond the commonly known free-to-play and play-to-win gaming models and allows players of any level to monetize their skills. Players choose their game and the stake and let the game do the matchmaking. The platform features several gaming modes: solo, party, teams, and pro seasons. Players can also join skill-filtered leagues and earn participation rewards in the native XED token. XED and NFT rewards depend on the amount of XED staked on the platform. The more XED a player has staked, the lower their match fees and the more access they receive to special tournaments, exclusive NFTs, and in-platform badges and skins.

Read our  deep dive into the future of gaming in a virtual world. Get the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Exeedme (XED) Coins Are There in Circulation? The total supply of XED is 100 million tokens. The token distribution is as follows: Foundational Reserve - 10% one-year lock, then 25% quarterly. Seed Sale - 10% vested over eight months. Pre-public Sale - 30% over three months 25% monthly. Ecosystem - 20% vested over eight months. Team - 10% one-year lock, then 25% quarterly. Ecosystem - 20% vested over eight months. Liquidity Fund - 20% vested over eight months. XED launched with a pre-public price of $0.03 and a Uniswap listing price of $0.05. Token holders can vote on the platform’s governance and propose new games to be added. Organizers are able to build their own community and start organizing tournaments past a certain stalking threshold. On the XED DEX, gamers will be able to swap, buy, and sell fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens. How Is the Exeedme Network Secured? XED an  ERC-20  token on Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC. Currently, the platform is a fully working Ethereum-based minimum viable product. In the future, Exeedme plans to be available on several blockchains using Polkadot. ERC-20 is a token standard most new tokens follow when publishing on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchains and the go-to solution for many decentralized applications and exchanges to launch on. It is secured by a  proof-of-work  consensus mechanism that requires miners to mine new Ether. A set of decentralized nodes validates transactions and secures the Ethereum blockchain. Can Exeedme Hit $1? Exeedme hit an all-time high of almost $2 in March, up from an initial launch price of $0.05. That indicates there is strong interest in the platform’s value proposition. However, it has since retraced to below $0.50. Whether the token will hit $1 again and possibly eclipse its previous high will depend on the implementation of new features and the acquisition of new users.  Where Can You Buy Exeedme (XED)? XED is available on  Uniswap V2 ,  Gate.io ,  PancakeSwap ,  QuickSwap  and  1Inch . Here are some other articles that you may be interested in: What Is a Crypto Faucet? What Are Crypto Debit Cards?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What is SORA? SORA is about creating a supranational economic system that can efficiently provide capital to producers, thus pushing humanity forward, as well as a supranational and democratic governance structure to allocate capital in a fair way. It is both a new economic system that decentralizes the concept of a central bank as well as a network that implements a new way to architect a parachain blockchain that connects to the Polkadot relay chain and ecosystem with built-in tools focused on DeFi. The SORA Network excels at providing tools for decentralized applications that use digital assets, such as atomic token swaps, bridging tokens to other blockchains, and creating programmatic rules involving digital assets. SORA XOR is the native utility token that is: Used for transaction fees (gas) on the SORA substrate network Elastic supply, managed by a  token bonding curve Enables holders of a certain amount to become a citizen and member of the  SORA Parliament Used to add liquidity to pairs on  Polkaswap Used to stake to become a validator or to  nominate validators  on the SORA Network More about  SORA tokenomics How Many SORA XOR Coins Are There in Circulation? SORA XOR supply is elastically managed by a  token bonding curve  smart contract with buy and sell price functions. This means that as the token supply increases, the price also increases, and vice versa. The  token bonding curve  (TBC) manages the supply of tokens in a rational way, without involvement of humans, and it creates a system that avoids the boom-bust problems of traditional economies and the deflationary economics of many cryptocurrencies. Where Can I Buy SORA XOR? SORA XOR is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges. One of the main exchanges is a cross-chain AMM DEX  Polkaswap . What Makes SORA Unique? The SORA substrate network bridges Ethereum and wil bridge Bitcoin to make cross-chain communication with both blockchains possible, while connecting to Polkadot and Kusama. This allows the Ethereum and Bitcoin communities to use SORA to access Polkadot and Kusama via a user-friendly bridge. With Polkaswap integration, users can trade any asset on Ethereum and Bitcoin on the Polkadot and Kusama networks and provide real cross-chain swaps. SORA Parliament is the governance system for the SORA Network, its main task  is to allocate newly minted XOR to productive projects. It has multiple bodies with clear separation of powers and where the members (Citizens) are chosen randomly. It is built around three main concepts: Isonomia: the principle that everyone who is a citizen has political equality Isegoria: the right of all citizens to speak and contribute Sortition: randomly choosing groups of citizens to make decisions To compensate citizens for their time, 1% of the funds that are allocatable to projects for productive uses shall be distributed to citizens. Learn more about  the Parliament and the governance bodies . Who Are the Founders of SORA? The founder of SORA, Makoto Takemiya, is the creator of the Proof-of-Importance algorithm used in NEM. He started his work on the SORA project back in August 2017. The key thesis of the SORA economic system is that for cryptoeconomic systems to be able to compete with contemporary, centralized economic systems, there needs to be a rational economic model. To create a rational economic model, the team did a survey of various economic theories. Over the course of this time Yokei Yamaguchi, an economist, joined the team in 2018, and he helped with several key parts of the model. On October 17, 2019, the SORA v1 Network launched. However, the technology has improved, giving the possibility to shape a new and more ambitious type of crypto ecosystem. Whereas the medium-term goal remains generating value for our community, analysis of the SORA economy has led to embrace the long-term goal of realizing a supranational world economic system. SORA v2 substrate Network is a profound and significant upgrade to the SORA Network and the SORA tokenomics.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is 1inch Network (1INCH)? The 1inch Network unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest, and protected operations in the DeFi space.  The 1inch Network's first protocol is a decentralized exchange ( DEX )  aggregator  solution that searches deals across multiple liquidity sources, offering users better rates than any individual exchange. The 1inch Aggregation Protocol incorporates the Pathfinder algorithm for finding the best paths across over 60+ liquidity sources on Ethereum, 30+ liquidity sources on Binance Smart Chain, 30+ liquidity sources on Polygon, Optimistic Ethereum, and Arbitrum. In just over two years of operation, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol surpassed $80 bln in overall trading volume on the Ethereum network alone.  The 1inch Liquidity Protocol is a next-generation automated market maker ( AMM ) that protects users from front-running attacks and offers attractive opportunities to liquidity providers.  The 1inch Limit Order Protocol facilitates the most innovative and flexible limit order swap opportunities in DeFi. The protocol’s features, such as dynamic pricing, conditional orders, and extra RFQ support, power various implementations, including stop-loss and trailing stop orders, as well as auctions.  The  1inch Wallet  is a multichain mobile platform that provides an easy-to-navigate interface with secure storing, transaction, and staking capabilities. This versatile wallet was built from the ground up to streamline interacting with 1inch’s features. The 1inch Network's governance token 1INCH is used to vote on protocol parameters under the decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) model.  In August 2020, 1inch got a $2.8 million funding raise from Binance Labs, Galaxy Digital, Greenfield One, Libertus Capital, Dragonfly Capital, FTX, IOSG, LAUNCHub Ventures, and Divergence Ventures. In December 2020, 1inch raised another $12 million in Series A funding, led by Pantera Capital, with others including ParaFi Capital, Blockchain Capital, Nima Capital, and Spartan Group. The funding round was conducted through a SAFT (simple agreement for future tokens) sale. Who Are the Founders of 1inch Network? The 1inch Network was founded by  Sergej Kunz  and  Anton Bukov  over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019. The two had earlier met during a live stream of Kunz’s YouTube channel (CryptoManiacs) and began entering hackathons together, winning a prize at a hackathon in Singapore, as well as two major awards from the ETHGlobal.  Prior to 1inch, Sergej Kunz worked as a senior developer at product price aggregator Commerce Connector, coded at communication agency Herzog, led projects at Mimacom consultancy, and then worked full time at Porsche in both DevOps and cybersecurity.  Anton Bukov had worked in software development since 2002 and in decentralized finance (DeFi) since 2017. Among other projects, his resume features gDAI.io and NEAR Protocol. What Makes 1inch Network Unique? In addition, to access to deepest liquidity from multiple sources on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimistic Ethereum, and Arbitrum, the 1inch Network offers users attractive prices and a high degree of security being the most audited project in DeFi. How is the 1inch Network secured? \n1inch is non-custodial, and all trades take place within one transaction from a user’s wallet on any of the supported blockchains and layer-2 networks.  The technical structure of all 1inch protocols provides a high degree of security to users as well. For example, insecure liquidity sources can connect to the 1inch Aggregation Protocol without users risking the loss of funds. The protocol integrates security checks during every transaction to prevent any losses. As of October 2021, more than 120 liquidity sources are integrated into the 1inch Network. 1inch smart contracts got audited by leading audit teams in the industry such as OpenZeppelin, Consensys diligence, SlowMist, Haechi Labs, CoinFabrik, Certik, Hacken, Scott Bigelow, MixBytes, and Chainsulting. Where can you buy 1INCH? \nAfter the 1INCH token was launched in late December 2020, all wallets that had interacted with the  1inch dApp  through midnight on December 24 received 1INCH tokens if they met certain criteria. Liquidity providers for the 1inch Liquidity Protocol are also getting 1INCH tokens according to the 1inch Foundation’s various incentives and liquidity mining programs. 1INCH is available on multiple exchanges, including  Binance ,  Huobi Global ,  Coinbase ,  FTX ,  Kraken ,  KuCoin , and  OKEx .

  "content": "What Is Algorand (ALGO)? Algorand is a self-sustaining,  decentralized ,  blockchain -based network that supports a wide range of applications. These systems are secure, scalable and efficient, all critical properties for effective applications in the real world. Algorand will support computations that require reliable performance guarantees to create new forms of trust. The Algorand  mainnet  became live in June 2019, and was able to handle almost 1 million transactions per day as of December 2020. Algorand transaction metrics can be viewed  here . Algorand  initial coin offering  (ICO) was held in June 2019, with the Algorand price of $2.4 per token. Who Are the Founders of Algorand? Silvio Micali is a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the founder of Algorand. He is a recipient of the Turing Award (in 2012) for his fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of secure two-party computation, electronic cash, cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols. This makes him one of the foremost creators of crypto in the world. What Makes Algorand Unique? Algorand was invented to speed up transactions and improve efficiency, in response to the slow transaction times of Bitcoin and other blockchains. Algorand is designed so that there are lower  transaction fees , as well as no mining (like  Bitcoin's  energy-intensive process), as it is based on a permissionless pure  proof-of-stake  (PoS) blockchain protocol.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is BarnBridge (BOND)? BarnBridge, founded in 2019, is a protocol for tokenizing risks. It was launched in September 2020. BarnBridge is a sort of decentralized finance ( DeFi ) lego for creating tradeable tokens that expose a consumer to market volatility. As of March 2021, the platform is still in an early stage of launch. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Quant . BarnBridge is a project that expands the functionality of DeFi to make it more flexible and efficient. By tokenizing market fluctuations and exposure to risks, it can reduce volatility for conservative investors or increase it for daytraders. BarnBridge enables traditional risk management tools and fixed income instruments on the DeFi market. The main focus is dividing cryptocurrency risks into tranches so market participants, depending on their risk profile, can invest in different products or assets. Who Are the Founders of BarnBridge? BarnBridge was co-founded by Troy Murray and Tyler Ward. Prior to working on BarnBridge, Murray founded a crypto R&D firm RUDE_labs, exploring the benefits that blockchain can bring to the media since 2012. He has also worked as director of strategy at Breaker and as a supervisor/technical architect at snglsDAO Foundation. Before going on to co-found BarnBridge, Ward has founded Proof Systems, a digital marketing company focused on the fintech industry. Ward has also worked with ConsenSys, Earn.com, FOAM, Dether, Grid +, Centrality, Sylo, NEAR Protocol, DARMA Capital, SingularDTV and snglsDAO. What Makes BarnBridge Unique? Sustainable DeFi platforms like Compound ( COMP ) and Aave ( AAVE ) provide over 5% annual percentage yield (APY) on some assets. With profitability optimizers like yEarn, APY can grow to over 10%. The drawback of these DeFi platforms is that they don't offer fixed income; additionally, adding cryptocurrencies to a portfolio means taking on significant risks as cryptocurrency assets are highly volatile. BarnBridge's advantage is that it can aggregate yields with fixed income and flatten them to improve the efficiency of the system. This helps make the entry into the crypto industry more personalized and predictable for consumers, opening it up to a wider audience. From the standpoint of traditional finance, BarnBridge can be used to improve the effectiveness of stock trading. BarnBridge creates tokenized derivatives based on market fluctuations. Examples of underlying markets include rates of return, prices, market prediction odds, default rates on mortgages and others. These derivative tokens are divided into high, medium and low risk/reward categories. BarnBridge is a cross-platform risk tokenization protocol with tranches of fixed income and volatility. BarnBridge also supports SMART Alpha Bonds that can be used to tokenize price risks. They can expose users to large, medium, or low price fluctuations. Smart Alpha Bonds on Ethereum can be used as derivatives to hedge against any ERC-20 token price fluctuations. BarnBridge’s principal competitors are other DeFi risk hedging platforms, such as the options trading platforms Hegic ( HEGIC ) and Opyn. Related Pages: Read more about  Harvest Finance .

We update our ZRX to USD price in real-time.   0x is down 3.54% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #105, with a live market cap of $1,056,834,172 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 845,496,055 ZRX coins   and a max. supply of 1,000,000,000 ZRX coins. If you would like to know where to buy  0x , the top exchanges for trading in  0x  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is 0x (ZRX)? 0x is an infrastructure protocol that allows users to easily trade ERC20 tokens and other assets on the  Ethereum  blockchain without relying on centralized intermediaries like traditional  cryptocurrency  exchanges. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  0x . 0x achieves this decentralized exchange functionality using a collection of open-source, publicly auditable  smart contracts  that work together to produce a flexible, low-friction trading protocol that developers can easily weave into their products.  The protocol is powered by an ERC20 utility token known as ZRX. Nodes that (also known as relayers) host an off-chain order book and offer user-facing applications that present this information and allow users to make, fill and cancel transactions are paid in ZRX tokens (as trading fees). ZRX can also be used to participate in platform governance, helping holders suggest and vote on changes to the protocol.  In 2019, 0x  announced  an overhaul of the ZRX token, adding extra functionality, allowing ZRX holders to delegate their stake to a market maker to earn passive rewards while retaining their voting capacity.  Who Are the Founders of 0x? 0x was founded in 2016 by Will Warren and Amir Bandeali. The two co-founders continue to serve the platform, with Will Warren as 0x's CEO, whereas Amir Bandeali is CTO. The platform launched following a successful initial coin offering ( ICO ) in 2017, during which it raised a total of $24 million — with support from prominent investment firms including Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital and FBG Capital.  Prior to the sell-out ICO, Warren worked in several research roles and briefly held the role of technical advisor to  Basic Attention Token (BAT) . Bandeali, on the other hand, graduated from the University of Illinois with a BSc in Finance and held several trading positions before co-founding 0x.  Now the team is composed of more than 30 individuals, including engineers, researchers and designers who work to update the platform and keep it running smoothly.  What Makes 0x Unique? Unlike many other Ethereum decentralized exchange protocols, 0x supports both fungible (ERC20) and non-fungible (ERC-723) tokens. This means it can be used for the permissionless trading of a wide range of assets, giving holders a way to buy, sell and exchange the vast majority of Ethereum assets through more than a dozen different apps.  The 0x protocol can be applied to a wide range of use cases, including eBay-style marketplaces for digital goods and services, OTC trading desks, exchange functionality for DeFi protocols and plain-old decentralized exchanges.  Although 0x can be used to build highly flexible exchange products, it can also be built into products where asset exchange is a secondary feature — such as for in-game purchases and portfolio management platforms.  On the 0x protocol, liquidity takers pay a fee in the form of ZRX tokens — this fee is used to incentivize market maker (relayer) liquidity. Users also need to pay a protocol fee in the form of Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for the gas used in any transactions they complete. As an open-source protocol, 0x does not receive any share of this revenue, and is instead supported by ZRX tokens unlocked as team and developer incentives — along with its initial ICO funding.

Like many digital assets, the ZRX token has a fixed maximum supply that will never be exceeded. This is set to 1 billion ZRX. Right now, around three quarters of this maximum supply is already in circulation, and just a small fraction of this is locked up for staking rewards.  Unlike many protocols, 0x has never publicly described the emission rate for new ZRX tokens, making it difficult to say how long it will take until the circulating supply is fully diluted. But with 50% of the circulating supply released when the token launched in August 2017 and 75% of the supply released as of October 2020, this indicates it may achieve full dilution in the early 2020s.  As per an  early blog entry  by 0x CEO Will Warren, half of the total ZRX token supply was sold to investors in the 2017 ICO, whereas 15% each is reserved for the 0x core development organization and external project development fund, while a further 10% is reserved for the founding team with a four year vesting schedule and one year cliff, and the remaining 10% is retained for early backers and advisors. How Is the 0x Network Secured? 0x is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is protected against attacks by the combined efforts of the massive Ethereum miner and node network. As for the underlying smart contracts, version 3 of the protocol has been audited by several third party firms which checked to see if there were any underlying vulnerabilities, backdoors and redundant functions, including  ConsenSys Diligence  — no major issues were found.  However, a vulnerability was found in the v2.0 smart contract, which was later patched by the 0x core team. This vulnerability was  detected  by an independent researcher and was not exploited. 0x continues to operate a generous bug bounty, to help detect and patch any issues before they can be exploited. Where Can You Buy 0x (ZRX)? ZRX is currently available to trade on well over 200 different exchange platforms, but the most popular ones include  Coinbase Pro ,  Binance  and  BitMax . It can currently be traded against a range of other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as several fiat currencies, including U.S. dollars (USD), euros (EUR) and South Korean won (KRW).

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is API3 (API3)? Smart contracts often struggle to access dependable data, but application programming interfaces ( APIs ) have been touted as a solution to this problem. API3’s stated goal is to allow decentralized versions of APIs to be built, managed and monetized at scales. As blockchain technology plays an ever bigger role in the economy — from decentralized finance to supply chain management — the team behind this project says it has never been more important for smart contracts to provide “timely, reliable real-world data.” The whitepaper for API3 was unveiled in September 2020 and set out the main problem that’s associated with APIs at present: connectivity. At present, there’s no way for smart contracts to establish a direct connection with APIs for the latest data — and this has led to an explosion in the popularity of oracles. Although this has helped solve the problem to some extent, the industry has since been grappling with the “Blockchain Oracle Problem.” Oracles are a form of middleware that sit in between APIs and smart contracts — increasing costs and centralization. API3 intends to get around this problem by enabling API providers to operate their very own nodes. API3’s token went live at the start of December following on from a token sale that generated tens of millions of dollars. Who Are the Founders of API3? Three people have come together to bring API3 to life. The first is Heikki Vanttinen, who has written extensively about the project and what it hopes to achieve. He previously worked as founder and CEO at CLC Group, a blockchain lab “developing real-world connected smart contract solutions for a more trustless, efficient and secure future.” Vanttinen also served as chief marketing officer at Zippie, a mobile operating system that aims to help blockchain technology achieve mainstream adoption. Vanttinen has been joined by Burak Benligiray. He also worked at CLC Group, serving as CTO. Benligiray has previously written posts highlighting the merits of ChainAPI, which serves as the integration platform for API3. This has been described as the “spiritual successor” to Honeycomb, which was one of the innovations that had been pursued by CLC Group. And last but by no means least, the third co-founder at API3 is Saša Milić. As well as serving as a sessional lecturer at the University of Toronto, where she taught core curriculum courses to computer science students, she’s also worked as a software engineer for Facebook, and as a simulation data scientist for Gauntlet. What Makes API3 Unique? In the world of blockchain and crypto, we all too often hear about projects that are aiming to bring this technology to established industries such as real estate and finance. One of the most compelling attributes of API3 is how it’s aiming to fix some of the problems that have emerged within the blockchain space itself. APIs are crucial because of how they supply blockchains with off-chain data — without it, these decentralized ledgers wouldn’t have a clue about how much coins should be worth. In setting out why API3 is unique, Vanttinen explained how decentralized APIs can “provide superior data transparency all the way to the factual data source level, compared to existing decentralized oracles, which do not consider the data source API to be within the scope of their solution.” Light and robust middleware called Airnode has been created to make API3 a reality — and the distinctive qualities of this tool concern how it can be deployed in minutes, enhancing transparency and substantially reducing transaction fees in the process.

Subscribe to the CoinMarketCap  newsletter . How Many API3 (API3) Coins Are There in Circulation? As of January 2020, CoinMarketCap data suggests that there are 13,847,549 API3 in circulation — out of a maximum supply of 100 million tokens. While 15 million tokens have been distributed among pre-seed and seed investors, a further 20 million tokens were reserved for a public token distribution event that took place over the first two weeks of December. The founding team was allocated 30 million tokens, with 10 million going to partners and contributors. And finally, 25 million went to an ecosystem fund. Tokens sold during a public sale are unlocked, but seed investors and founders are subject to a vesting period of between two and three years. How Is the API3 Network Secured? API3 is an  ERC-20  token, meaning that it’s based on the  Ethereum  blockchain.  Where Can You Buy API3 (API3)? One of the most popular exchanges where API3 can be purchased include  Uniswap , where it is paired with Wrapped ETH. It’s also available against UDST on Huobi Global and KuCoin, and paired with ETH on OKEx and 1inch.  Learn more about how to convert fiat currencies to crypto in our handy guide.

Stellar is up 5.29% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #22, with a live market cap of $9,446,772,557 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 24,199,201,384 XLM coins   and a max. supply of 50,001,806,812 XLM coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Stellar , the top exchanges for trading in  Stellar  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Stellar (XLM)? Put simply, Stellar is an open network that allows money to be moved and stored. When it was released in July 2014, one of its goals was boosting financial inclusion by reaching the world’s unbanked — but soon afterwards, its priorities shifted to helping financial firms connect with one another through blockchain technology. The network’s native token, lumens, serves as a bridge that makes it less expensive to trade assets across borders. All of this aims to challenge existing payment providers, who often charge high fees for a similar service. If all of this sounds familiar, it is worth noting that Stellar was originally based on the Ripple Labs protocol. The blockchain was created as a result of hard fork, and the code was subsequently rewritten. Who Are the Founders of Stellar? Jed McCaleb founded Stellar with the lawyer Joyce Kim after leaving Ripple in 2013 over disagreements about the company’s future direction. In explaining the rationale behind Stellar in September 2020,  McCaleb told CoinMarketCap : “The whole original design of Stellar is that you can have fiat currencies and other kinds of forms of value run in parallel with each other and with crypto assets. This is super important to drive this stuff mainstream.” McCaleb’s goal is to ensure that Stellar can give people a way of moving their fiat into crypto — and eliminate the friction that people normally experience when they are sending money around the world. He currently serves as the CTO of Stellar, as well as the co-founder of the Stellar Development Foundation. This not-for-profit organization aims to “unlock the world’s economic potential by making money more fluid, markets more open, and people more empowered.” What Makes Stellar Unique? Fees are a sticking point for many. However, high costs when making cross-border payments aren’t just exclusive to fiat-based payments solutions such as PayPal — transaction fees have also been known to go through the roof on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains because of congestion. Stellar is unique because every transaction costs just 0.00001 XLM. Given how one unit of this cryptocurrency only costs a few cents at the time of writing, this helps ensure that users keep more of their money. Few blockchain projects have managed to secure partnerships with big-brand technology companies and fintech firms. A few years ago, Stellar and IBM teamed up to launch World Wire, a project that allowed large financial institutions to submit transactions to the Stellar network and transact using bridge assets such as stablecoins. Although other blockchains have community funds, meaning that grants can be given to projects that help further the ecosystem, Stellar allows its users to vote on which ventures should be given this support.

A total of 100 billion XLM were issued when the Stellar network launched in 2015 — but things have changed since the release date. At present, the total supply stands at 50 billion XLM, and the circulating supply is currently 20.7 billion. In 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation announced that it was burning over half of the cryptocurrency’s supply. This means that it now controls approximately 30 billion XLM. While some of this capital is earmarked for marketing and helping the organization develop, about one third is reserved for making investments in other blockchain ventures. Explaining why it took this drastic move — and promising not to burn any more XLM in the future — the foundation explained: “SDF can be leaner and do the work it was created to do using fewer lumens… Those 55.5 billion lumens weren’t going to increase the adoption of Stellar.” How Is the Stellar Network Secured? This network is secured using the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which is described as having four main properties: “Decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.” Through SCP, anyone is able to join the process of achieving consensus, and no single entity can end up with the majority of decision-making power. Transactions are also confirmed cheaply and within a few seconds — and safeguards are in place if bad actors attempt to join the network. Where Can You Buy Stellar (XLM)? It is possible to  buy Stellar  from a wide range of top exchanges - including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Upbit and Huobi. It’s also common to convert fiat into Bitcoin before purchasing altcoins,  and you can find out more about how this is done with our guide.

It facilitates Bitcoin holders acting on the Ethereum blockchain, accessing the DeFi ecosystem, and earning with their Bitcoin. KEEP is the network’s native work token with dividends and a slashing model. It provides the sybil resistance that allows the Keep network to be censorship resistant and permissionless. KEEP can be used to: Secure the Keep Network and tBTC via staking Run the random beacon and ECDSA nodes on the network Run tBTC, similar to running a full node. KEEP stakers can play an even larger role as tBTC signers by bonding ETH. Earn fees for providing work on the network KEEP applications and tools include:  Keep Random Beacon tBTC - a decentralized Bitcoin bridge on Ethereum Keep Token Dashboard   an interface to manage and stake your KEEP Keep Stats   high level summary of Keep and tBTC network stats All the Keeps   a tool to monitor all tBTC deposits on the Keep network How Many KEEP Coins Are There in Circulation? The Keep Network launched its mainnet on April 27th, 2020 with 1 billion KEEP tokens created. KEEP tokens are a fixed supply asset, there will never be more than 1 billion KEEP in existence.  About the Keep Team The Keep Network was founded in 2017 by Matt Luongo and Corbin Pon, crypto industry veterans who previously founded the Bitcoin rewards app Fold.  The Keep Network’s early supporting stakers include Polychain, Andreessen Horowitz, Draper Associates, Paradigm, Fenbushi, A.Capital, Collaborative Fund, and ParaFi among others.  The Keep project employs more than 20 staff, including engineers with deep experience in discrete mathematics and cryptography, and business leadership from ConsenSys’s founding days.  What Makes Keep Unique? When it comes to dApps and DeFi projects...the team shouldn’t have the keys. The Keep Network features off-chain containers for private data called keeps that give smart contracts deep interactivity with private data without compromising transparency or auditability.  tBTC, the first application built on the Keep Network, is censorship-resistant because it uses keeps to store data. Each TBTC token is fully backed and matched by at least 1 BTC held in reserve. tBTC is trustless, using Keep’s random beacon to select “signers” who are bonded in ETH and have responsibility for the deposited BTC. This means you can convert TBTC to BTC, and vice-versa, whenever you want, with no intermediary needed to sign off.  Where Can I Get Keep (KEEP)?

Balancer is up 2.00% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #328, with a live market cap of $190,786,218 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 6,943,831 BAL coins   and a max. supply of 100,000,000 BAL coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Balancer , the top exchanges for trading in  Balancer  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Balancer (BAL)?  Balancer is an automated market maker ( AMM ) that was developed on the Ethereum blockchain and launched in March 2020. It was able to raise a $3M seed round by Placeholder and Accomplice.  Balancer protocol  functions as a self-balancing weighted portfolio, price sensor and liquidity provider. It allows users to earn profits through its recently introduced token ($BAL) by contributing to customizable liquidity pools.  To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Balancer]( https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-balancer . The protocol operates a few types of pools: Private pools  give the owner governance over the pool, and make the person the sole contributor of liquidity to the pool. Also, all the parameters are mutable by the owner. Shared pools  are for those who want to become  liquidity providers  (LPs). The LPs are rewarded with the Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs). Smart pools  are similar to private pools but are controlled by a smart contract. They also reward using BPTs and allow anyone to contribute liquidity to the pool. Who Are the Founders of Balancer? Balancer Lab was founded by Fernando Martinelli and Mike McDonald, but it began as a research program at a software firm “BlockScience” in 2018. The Balancer project features intelligent, like-minded fellows with an acute understanding of the DeFi space.  Fernando Martnelli , a serial entrepreneur and Maker community member, has many years of work experience outside of Balancer. He co-founded many other companies before he started Balancer with his partner, Mike McDonald.  Mike McDonald  is the co-founder and CTO at Balancer. He is a security engineer and the creator of mkr.tools He joined Fernando Martnelli to build the Balancer platform. Kristen Stone , COO at Balancer, has worked in the crypto industry for over five years. She was a product manager at Coinbase and has built teams in product and engineering. Timur Badretdinov , is the frontend developer and has worked on several projects before working at Balancer. He founded a company called “Longcaller,” a platform focused on providing cryptocurrency reviews and educational blockchain content. What Makes Balancer Unique? Balancer is similar to  Uniswap  and  Curve , in that it enables anyone to create pools of tokens. The pool adjusts itself to keep the tokens equally weighted regardless of changes in their price. However,  one unique feature  of Balancer is that more than one token can be added and ETH isn’t required.  Although, Balancer isn’t the first DeFi protocol to make use of AMMs, however, it has brought a new face and approach to liquidity. The unique feature of the protocol is that it allows Liquidity providers to have up to eight assets per market which are weighted by percentage and rebalanced automatically.  With Balancer, users don’t have to deposit 50% of the desired asset, but are allowed to decide how much of a supported asset they wish to deposit. Another unique feature of Balancer Lab is that users can make a high return on assets that are in low demand through arbitrage opportunities and slippage-reduction. You can learn more about how Balancer works  here .  How Many Balancer Tokens (BAL) Are There in Circulation? Balancer wasn’t launched with a native token. However, in June 2020, they launched a governance token, $BAL, following the success of Compound’s token COMP. The purpose of the token is to allow for more decentralization and as an incentive for LP.  Of the total 100M tokens that were created, 25M were reserved for the team, core developers, investors and advisors. 5M tokens were allocated for the Balancer Ecosystem Fund, which would be used as incentives for strategic partners. Another 5M were allocated for the fundraising fund. This fund will be used by Balancer to support its operation and growth at future fundraisings. The remaining tokens are to be mined by liquidity providers on the platform and are released at a rate of 145K per week. Provided the distribution rate is kept constant, it would take approx. 8.6 years to finish distributing the tokens.  How Is the Balancer Network Secured? For Balancer, security is a top priority and that is why the protocol has been fully audited three times by Trail of Bits, ConsenSys and OpenZeppelin. There are no admin keys or backdoors, hence, making it trustless, and the balancer pools are not upgradeable. Balancer does not support tokens that do not conform to the  ERC-20  standard, even though they may be in use on some pools. The tokens held on Balancer pools are not controlled by Balancer, but are smart contracts. Nevertheless, that does not remove the inherent risks of smart contracts. The configurable rights pools (CRPs) ensure that tokens with known issues are barred from being used in pools. It further ensures that all other tokens safely interact with the protocol Where Can You Buy Balancer Token (BAL)? Balancer allows users to add to liquidity pools to earn $BAL, which is automatically awarded to the users weekly. Top exchanges that support $BAL include Binance, ZenGo, Global, HBTC, Kraken, OKEx, Huobi, etc. To learn how to exchange your fiat currencies for $BAL, here is a detailed  guide  on how to go about that.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Nexo (NEXO)? Nexo is a  blockchain -based lending platform that offers users instant  cryptocurrency -backed loans. Users deposit an accepted token — such as  Bitcoin  (BTC),  Ether  (ETH),  Litecoin  (LTC) or  XRP  (XRP) — as collateral to receive a loan in the form of a fiat currency or  stablecoin . Nexo has a native token, NEXO, that when locked in the platform grants users benefits such as discounts on interest accumulated on loans and the opportunity to receive interest payments on funds deposited. Token holders also receive dividends from Nexo's profits. The project was first  announced  in December 2017, and it  launched  in April 2018. Who Are the Founders of Nexo? Nexo  was founded by a team of finance professionals and crypto enthusiasts, who turned to blockchain to create the crypto equivalent to a service well established in traditional finance, but hitherto non-existent in digital finance— borrowing against the value of your assets while retaining ownership. In 2018, the team launched the Nexo platform, offering the world’s first crypto credit lines that allowed digital asset holders to obtain fiat and stablecoin loans against their cryptocurrency, and thus setting the foundations of the crypto lending niche.  The collective behind Nexo has a combined experience of over 30 years in financial services, including non-crypto lending, investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, and hedge funds, with Co-founder and Managing Partner  Antoni Trenchev  additionally contributing with experience in Finance Law and in KYC and AML solutions.  Trenchev, who has acted as the public face of Nexo’s leadership, has a track record in advocating for wider blockchain and crypto adoption, notably serving as member of parliament in Bulgaria’s National Assembly from 2015 to 2017, where he promoted the implementation of blockchain solutions for e-government services, as well as frequently commenting on crypto and digital finance-related current events to mainstream media, including  Bloomberg ,  The Independent , and  CNBC .  Nexo currently services over a million users across 200+ jurisdictions, managing over $4 billion in assets. The company currently has 150 employees, with its management based in London. What Makes Nexo Unique? According to its  whitepaper , Nexo is the  first-ever  provider of instant cryptocurrency-backed loans and it intends to solve inefficiencies in the lending market. Its automated lending process uses  smart contracts  and an  oracle  on the  Ethereum  blockchain to manage loans. After a user transfers cryptocurrency to a Nexo-controlled wallet, the oracle establishes the loan and the user is instantly allocated the funds. When the user makes a deposit in order to repay the loan, the oracle returns the cryptocurrency and records the transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts are used to power NEXO and to record user balances. Nexo is  marketed  to individual and institutional investors, cryptocurrency companies, exchanges, miners and others who want  liquidity  from their assets. The company makes a profit from the interest accumulated on loans, and it also offers institutional lending and consulting services. Nexo seeks to build a user base of clients that continue to use the platform and remain invested in NEXO. As such, the company announced a loyalty program that rewards those who keep NEXO in their accounts, giving them preferential interest rates on  loans  and higher yields on  savings . Nexo also  distributes  30% of its profits to NEXO token holders in the form of dividends. Related Pages: Learn about  SALT , another crypto-collateralized lending platform.

Stay up to date on the latest in  decentralized finance  and crypto lending with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many Nexo (NEXO) Coins Are There in Circulation? Nexo has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Of this amount, the supply was  allocated  in the following manner: 250 million NEXO (25%) for the company's overdraft funding reserves, subject to a 12-month vesting period with a six-month cliff; 112.5 million NEXO (11.25%) for the founders and team, subject to a 48-month quarterly vesting period; 60 million NEXO (6%) for community building and airdrop campaigns, subject to an 18-month quarterly vesting period; 52.5 million NEXO (5.25%) for advisors, legal costs and marketing, subject to a 12-month vesting period; 525 million NEXO (52.5%) for sale to investors. While Nexo initially planned to have a public presale and main token sale, it later  canceled  its public sales due to an overwhelming amount of interest from investors in its private sale. In October 2020, the company  announced  that it was launching a \"Nexonomics\" initiative to drive its  tokenomics  and increase the value of NEXO. The company subsequently  revealed  that it would buy back $12 million worth of NEXO. How Is the Nexo Network Secured? Nexo is a privately owned company and, as such, is responsible for the security of its networks and user funds. Nexo  stores  its digital assets with BitGo, a crypto-asset custodian that keeps tokens in cold storage wallets and is covered by a $100 million insurance policy. In November 2019, Nexo  reported  that it was ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified after being audited by RINA and the Consortium for IT Software Quality. Its native token, NEXO, is an  ERC-20  token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that any on-chain NEXO transactions are validated and secured by the Ethereum mainnet using its Ethash  proof-of-work   consensus  algorithm. Miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain, and a majority of all nodes in the network must validate a record for it to be posted. Upon its launch, Nexo  reported  that its token had been \"fully audited.\" In November 2019, the smart contracts were independently  audited  by Castillo Network, which found no critical security issues. Where Can You Buy Nexo (NEXO)? NEXO can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as  Huobi Global ,  UPEX ,  Hoo  and  Bitrue , among others. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the South Korean won and the Indian rupee, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Ether  (ETH), and the stablecoin  Tether  (USDT).

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Ren (REN)? Ren (REN) is an open protocol built to provide interoperability and  liquidity  between different  blockchain  platforms.  To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Ren . Formerly known as Republic Protocol, Ren launched RenVM, its virtual machine mainnet, in May 2020, having completed a $34 million initial coin offering ( ICO ) in 2018. The protocol’s native token, REN, functions as a bond for those running nodes which power RenVM, known as Darknodes. Ren aims to expand the interoperability, and hence accessibility, of decentralized finance ( DeFi ) by removing hurdles involved in liquidity between blockchains. Who Are the Founders of Ren? Ren was founded by Taiyang Zhang, its CEO, in 2017. Initially called Republic Protocol, Ren was first announced in January 2018, with Zhang explaining its initial use case as a “decentralized dark pool.” Zhang himself has existing experience in the cryptocurrency space, having also co-founded crypto hedge fund Virgil Capital.  Prior to that, Zhang co-founded Neucode, a software and web development startup, in 2014. Jaz Gulati, Neucode’s other co-founder, now works as a software developer for Ren.  What Makes Ren Unique? Ren is a complex platform with multiple use cases, but it is ultimately designed to overcome barriers to entry and investment for DeFi projects. As a plug-in, it allows DeFi projects to bring foreign cryptocurrency assets such as  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Zcash  (ZEC) to their offerings. More broadly, users can in essence swap any token between any two blockchains without middle steps such as using so-called “wrapped” versions of tokens, for example Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) and Wrapped Ethereum ( WETH ). RenVM  is a network of virtual computers making up a virtual machine. The machines powering the network which makes up RenVM are called Darknodes. Ren charges various fees for internal operations, but most do not go towards direct profitability, instead being paid to miners. As an  ERC-20  token, REN also attracts varying gas fees to power transactions. Related Pages : Find out more about Chainlink  here . Find out more about Cosmos  here . New to cryptocurrency?

How Many Ren (REN) Coins Are There in Circulation? REN has a fixed supply cap of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. Ren conducted a presale and public token sale in 2018, during which a total of 60.2% of the supply was sold to investors.  Ren has a reserve fund which was originally allocated 19.9% of the total supply, while another 9.9% was allocated internally to advisors, the team and its founders. Team tokens came with a two-year lock-up period, with a six-month lock-up for advisor allocations. Another 10% of the REN supply is specifically intended for activities such as partnerships and development. REN is an ERC-20 standard token. How Is the Ren Network Secured? RenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that facilitates ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via secure mutli-party computation (sMPC). This allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys on different blockchains, making it possible to shift tokens between these blockchains (i.e interoperability). The network is currently in phase sub-zero in its pathway to decentralization, for more information on RenVM’s pathway to decentralization, please refer to  Ren’s Wiki Where Can You Buy Ren (REN)? REN is a freely-tradable token and has a presence on various major exchanges. Of these,  Binance  and  Huobi Global  have the largest volume as of October 2020. Pairs include cryptocurrency, fiat and stablecoins. Crypto newbie? Read our  easy guide  to buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Bitcoin Vault (BTCV)? Bitcoin Vault is based on Bitcoin’s SHA-256 cryptographic hash function, but brings a revolution in the security aspect through the anti-theft solution using an innovative three-key proprietary wallet. Thanks to it, BTCV users have a 24-hour window to cancel unauthorized transactions.\nThe idea is to give users the possibility to react and eliminate potential theft by reversing the transaction in case one private key is lost or stolen. By delaying the default time necessary to transfer assets from one block (around 10 minutes) to 144 blocks (24 hours), and providing another key to cancel the transfer, users can rest assured that their funds are secure. What Makes Bitcoin Vault Unique? The ecosystem of Bitcoin Vault will allow you to create different types of wallets: · Standard,\n· 2-Key Vault,\n· and 3-Key Vault wallet. Each one of them can be used to send and receive crypto assets, but the transactions are different. Apart from Standard transactions, which lack additional security features, users can also make quick Secure Fast transactions and reversible Secure transactions. The reversible transactions are a novelty in the crypto world. They can be canceled within approximately 24 hours, which is the time it takes to mine 144 blocks to confirm the transaction on the blockchain. Now, when a suspicious or erroneous transaction occurs, users have a chance to stop it before their funds are gone! Bitcoin Vault Security Keys • Standard Transaction Key The Standard Transaction key is generated along with each wallet. It mainly runs in the background to ensure the smooth operation of all transactions. Apart from functioning like an invisible layer of extra safety, it can also be used to recover the wallet in case of a security breach or technical issue. • Cancel Transaction Key As the name suggests, this key allows users to cancel transactions. This has been made possible by regulating the number of blocks it takes to confirm the transaction on the blockchain to 144. It allows wallet owners to reverse a transaction within approximately 24 hours of a regular BTCV transfer. • Fast Transaction Key This key is necessary to perform Fast transactions. It can be used to execute a transfer in about 10 minutes, after one block is generated, allowing BTCV users to make quick transactions with trusted parties. How Many Bitcoin Vault (BTCV) Coins Are There In Circulation? The total supply of Bitcoin Vault is limited by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are created during the process known as “mining”: as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is MANTRA DAO (OM)? MANTRA DAO is a  decentralized finance  platform with a specific focus on staking, lending and decentralized governance. The project is being built on the  blockchain  RioChain and will be connected with  Polkadot . It is intended to act as an ecosystem for Web 3.0. The platform uses a native utility token, OM, for staking, lending and governance. While the project plans to move to the Polkadot network, the token has been initially issued on the  Ethereum  blockchain. MANTRA DAO was first  announced  in June 2020, and the platform  went live  with its first feature, staking, in October 2020. Who Are the Founders of MANTRA DAO? MANTRA DAO was developed as a project of RioDeFi, the blockchain tech development company behind RioChain, where co-founders and long-time  friends  John Patrick Mullin and Will Corkin  were  advisors. The two launched the project as a  decentralized autonomous organization  alongside colleague Rodrigo Quan Miranda. Mullin previously carried out fintech research at Chinese investment bank Guotai Junan Securities and has covered blockchain tech for both traditional and crypto media outlets. In September 2020, he was  appointed  a strategic advisor for  Polkastarter , a Polkadot-based  decentralized exchange . Corkin was previously vice president of business development for blockchain development company Trade.io, where he  worked  alongside Mullin. Corkin has also worked for FinTech Connector, a professional network for fintech startups and entrepreneurs. Along with Mullin, he is an ambassador for the Polkadot network. Miranda  founded  Moon Street Ventures, a blockchain research and development and consulting company, and co-founded and served as CEO of Immutable Technologies Corp, a decentralized network infrastructure provider. He was previously an investment banker. Mullin, Corkin and Miranda, along with RioDeFi CEO James Anderson and chief marketing officer Stephane Laurent Villedieu, form the founding council of MANTRA DAO. What Makes MANTRA DAO Unique? According to MANTRA DAO, several  announced  features make the project unique. First, it is being built on RioChain and will be connected with Polkadot, which it  described  as a \"next-generation blockchain.\" Second, it offers multiasset staking, lending and borrowing for both its own platform and others such as  Cosmos  (ATOM) and  Terra  (LUNA). Third, it  operates  MANTRA POOL through which 25% of the foundation's staking rewards are given away. And finally, it uses a \"karma\" protocol that assigns scores to network participants based on their contributions, granting users with high scores increased benefits. The MANTRA DAO ecosystem is powered by OM, which is used to govern the DAO and for staking and lending. OM token holders receive an estimated 88.8% annualized reward for staking on the platform. OM was issued as an  ERC-20 token , but the platform plans to migrate to the Polkadot network. As  outlined  in its  whitepaper , the business plan of MANTRA DAO is focused on collecting interest on loans, staking OM, operating a staking-as-a-service business that charges fees on staked assets, and providing business-to-business access to its products. A number of investment firms  backed  its \"initial membership offering,\" including Kenetic Capital, Genesis Block and Moonrock Capital.

Stay up to date on the latest developments in the DeFi sector with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many MANTRA DAO (OM) Coins Are There in Circulation? MANTRA DAO has a total token supply of 888,888,888 OM. Of this amount, 75.6 million OM (8.5%) was sold during a presale and \"initial membership offering\" that  kicked off  in July 2020. An additional 80 million (9%) was allocated for private distribution, with a six-month vesting period. The remaining tokens were  distributed  as follows: 155.6 million OM (17.5%) for the team and advisors, with one-eighteenth coming into circulation every 30 days. 266.7 million OM (30%) for staking rewards, the majority of which will be released in a nonlinear decaying growth function over approximately five years. 111.1 million OM (12.5%) for funding referral programs, the majority of which will be released on a rolling basis in a linear pattern over approximately five years. 88.9 million OM (10%) for reserves, much of which will be released on a rolling basis in a linear pattern over five years. 111.1 million OM (12.5%) for grants to fund protocol development initiatives. According to its whitepaper, users are required to send 1 OM to a MANTRA DAO-controlled wallet in order to enter into the MANTRA POOL, the total of which will be burned every quarter. However, in November 2020, the project  stated  that it does not plan to burn any tokens. How Is the MANTRA DAO Network Secured? MANTRA DAO's OM governance token is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that OM transactions are validated by the Ethereum network. Ethereum uses a  proof-of-work   consensus  algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted. The project appointed custody provider Hex Trust as the custodian for its digital assets, and in December 2020, the project  announced  that the  smart contracts  for the next iteration of its OM token had been audited by blockchain security company SlowMist. MANTRA DAO will migrate to Polkadot via RioChain, which was  audited  in September 2020 by blockchain cybersecurity firm CertiK, finding no major security flaws. Where Can You Buy MANTRA DAO (OM)? OM can be purchased on  cryptocurrency  exchanges such as Hotbit, OKEx, Bithumb Global and  Uniwap (V2) , among others. It can be traded on spot markets against the New Taiwan dollar, cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Ether  (ETH), and the stablecoin  Tether  (USDT).

If you would like to know where to buy  OMG Network , the top exchanges for trading in  OMG Network  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,    and   FTX .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . To learn more about this project, check out our  deep dive into OMG Network , now the OMG Foundation. What Is OMG Network (OMG)? OMG Network, formerly known as OmiseGo, is a non-custodial, layer-2 scaling solution built for the Ethereum  blockchain . As an Ethereum scaling solution, OMG Network is designed to allow users to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens significantly faster and cheaper than when transacting directly on the Ethereum network.  The network is based on a novel scaling solution called MoreViable Plasma, which uses a sidechain architecture to group several transactions off-chain into a batch, which can then be verified as a single transaction on the Ethereum root chain. According to OMG Network, this technology has the potential to scale  Ethereum  to thousands of transactions per second (TPS) — instead of the 10 to 14 tps Ethereum 1.0 is currently capable of.  The network is powered by the OMG utility token, which can be used as one of the payment methods for fees on the OMG Network, and will eventually be stakable — helping to secure the network in return for rewards.  Who Are the Founders of OMG Network? The OMG Network currently consists of a team of more than 50 employees scattered across the world. It was founded by Thai-born Vansa Chatikavanij and operates as a subsidiary of SYNQA — a Thailand-based fintech firm that was formerly known as Omise Holdings. As the projector founder, Vansa Chatikavanij received a master’s degree in earth and environmental sciences at New York's Columbia University. Following this, Chatikavanij held several consulting roles at prominent financial institutions including the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and World Bank Group, before founding OMG Network (then OmiseGo) in 2017.  Chatikavanij held the role of managing director at the company until 2019, before transitioning to the role of CEO, which she still holds to this day. Beyond this, Stephen McNamara — former head of blockchain R&D strategy at Huawei Technologies — is OMG Network's COO, whereas Kasima Tharnpipitchai, a heavily experienced engineer and consultant, is its CTO.  What Makes OMG Network Unique? OMG Network believes that Ethereum’s significant speed and cost barriers will need to be overcome before mainstream businesses will consider building their products and applications on the network.  As such, the OMG Network project is built to help make Ethereum more attractive to businesses and projects that want to scale while simultaneously cutting down on their carbon footprint. It achieves this with its plasma-based sidechain solution, which can help reduce electricity usage by up to 99% compared to Ethereum and cut fees by around two thirds, while ensuring assets remain secured by the underlying Ethereum network.  The platform itself is supported by $25 million in funding obtained during its 2017 initial coin offering ( ICO ). Moreover, OMG Network parent firm SYNQA recently raised a further $80 million in Series C funding — and was supported by several major investment firms, including Toyota Financial Services Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.

Like most  cryptocurrencies , OMG Network tokens have a fixed maximum supply. This is set at exactly 140,245,398 OMG and will never increase beyond this point. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, this total supply has already been fully minted, with the majority already in active circulation.  Of the total supply, 65.1% of tokens were distributed to investors and 5% were distributed in an airdrop, whereas the last 29.9% is held by the project and team. Of this 29.9%, 20% is locked in the OMG Network reserve smart contract for funding future developments and network validation, and the remaining 9.9% is reserved for the founding team. Both the OMG reserve and team allocation were locked for one year, but this has since elapsed.  How Is OMG Network Secured? The OMG Network mainnet will eventually move to a  proof-of-stake (POS)  consensus system, which will allow users to stake their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards.  Until then, OMG Network child chains are secured by a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which is basically a simplified form of proof-of-stake which is controlled by a single block producer (OMG Network itself) for now — which essentially stakes its reputation on staying honest.  OMG Network plans to transition to proof-of-stake as soon as it’s ready, following which OMG holders will be able to become stakeholders in the success and security of the network, by delegating their  stake  to validators.  Where Can You Buy OMG Network (OMG) Tokens? OMG tokens are highly liquid and can be purchased or traded on well over 200 different exchange platforms, including several top 10 exchanges — such as  Coinbase Pro  and  Binance . Some of the most popular trading pairs include OMG/USDT, OMG/BTC and OMG/ETH. OMG can also be traded against several fiat currencies, including U.S. dollars (USD), euros (EUR) and British pound sterling (GBP).

The Graph is down 2.00% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #42, with a live market cap of $4,661,911,423 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 4,715,735,200 GRT coins   and a max. supply of 10,057,044,431 GRT coins. If you would like to know where to buy  The Graph , the top exchanges for trading in  The Graph  are currently  Binance ,   OKEx ,   CoinTiger ,   FTX ,    and   Huobi Global .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is The Graph (GRT)? The Graph  is an indexing protocol for querying data for networks like Ethereum and IPFS, powering many applications in both  DeFi  and the broader  Web3 ecosystem . Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL to retrieve blockchain data. There is a hosted service in production that makes it easy for developers to get started building on The Graph and the decentralized network will be launching later this year. The Graph currently supports indexing data from Ethereum, IPFS and POA, with more networks coming soon.  To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  The Graph . To date, over  3,000 subgraphs  have been deployed by thousands of developers, for DApps like Uniswap, Synthetix, Aragon, AAVE, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Decentraland and many others. The Graph usage has been growing at over 50% MoM and hit over 7 billion queries during the month of September 2020.  The Graph has a global community, including over 200 Indexer Nodes in the testnet and more than 2,000 Curators in the Curator Program as of October 2020. To fund network development, The Graph raised funds from community members, strategic VCs and influential individuals in the blockchain community including Coinbase Ventures, DCG, Framework, ParaFi Capital, CoinFund, DTC, Multicoin, Reciprocal Ventures, SPC, Tally Capital and others. The Graph Foundation also successfully completed a public GRT Sale with participation from 99 countries (not including the U.S.). To date as of November 2020, The Graph has raised ~$25M.  Who Are the Founders of The Graph? The Graph team includes professionals from the Ethereum Foundation, OpenZeppelin, Decentraland, Orchid, MuleSoft leading up to the IPO and acquisition by Salesforce, Puppet, Redhat and Barclays. The initial co-founding team includes Yaniv Tal (project lead), Brandon Ramirez (research lead) and Jannis Pohlmann (tech lead).  The founders have engineering backgrounds and have worked together for 5-8 years. Tal and Ramirez studied electrical engineering at USC and worked together at MuleSoft, an API developer tools company that underwent an IPO and sold to SalesForce.  They previously co-founded a developer tools startup together and have spent a significant portion of their careers working to optimize the API stack. At their last startup, the founders built a custom framework on an immutable database called Datomic. The Graph was born from this vision to create immutable APIs and data access, using the GraphQL query language. What Makes The Graph Unique? The Graph is working to bring reliable decentralized public infrastructure to the mainstream market. To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants use Graph Token (GRT). GRT is a work token that is locked-up by Indexers, Curators and Delegators in order to provide indexing and curating services to the network. GRT will be an ERC-20 token on the  Ethereum blockchain , used to allocate resources in the network. Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can earn income from the network proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake. Indexers earn indexing rewards (new issuance) and query fees, while Curators earn a portion of query fees for the subgraphs they signal on. Delegators earn a portion of income earned by the Indexer they delegate to.  Related Pages: For more information about cryptocurrencies, check out CMC’s educational portal,  Alexandria . Curious about the latest crypto news? Read CMC’s  blog ! How Many The Graph (GRT) Coins Are There in Circulation? Total GRT supply at mainnet launch will be 10 billion tokens, with an initial circulating supply of ~1,245,666,867 GRT. New token issuance in the form of indexing rewards will begin at 3% annually and is subject to future technical governance by The Graph Council. You can read about GRT token economics  here  and distribution information  here .  How Is The Graph Network Secured? The Graph has built an open data layer on top of blockchains: Indexers can run their own Ethereum archive nodes to run Graph Node, or they can use node operators like Infura or Alchemy.  Any analytics company can build an application to query subgraph data that’s indexed by The Graph. Subgraphs are open APIs to be able to pull data from the blockchain in the most seamless and efficient way.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . X-Cash DPoPS Makes Staking Private and Secure The DPOPS ( Delegated-Proof-of-Private Stake) is a brand new and unique protocol that focuses on privacy. The protocol offers a range of privacy features that include,\n●  Privacy Flexibility : One single wallet on a single blockchain can be used to perform public and private transactions at the discretion of the users. This enables anonymity to be used when privacy is needed, while allowing for transparent transactions when required.\n●  Privacy Swap : Always putting the user experience first, X-Cash is the first blockchain to offer this feature with such a high level of ease from the user perspective.\n●  Secured & Unfalsifiable : Private and public transactions are cryptographically signed in large fixed ring-sized transactions. The X-Cash Public Network is governed by 50 delegates through a custom Delegated Proof of Stake consensus designed on top of the Monero technology, the Delegated Proof of Private Stake (DPOPS). ■  Secured by the top 50 elected delegates : Anyone can run an X-Cash node and become a delegate. But to be able to forge new blocks, secure the network, and earn the block reward, you will need to be voted into the top 50 by other members of the community.‌\n■  Staking & Voting : The delegates are elected by the community. Each person can attribute a stake of a minimum of 2M XCASH to a delegate to represent a weighted vote. Additionally, the voters' stake never leaves their wallet thanks to the use of cryptographic reserve proofs; you stay in control of your XCASH at all times.\n■  Improved security : Using a DBFT communication system to guarantee a 67% consensus, and a verifiable randomized selection of a block producer to avoid delegates targeted attacks, everything has been implemented to improve the security of the network. X-Cash has since the beginning of the project brought new innovation to the privacy coin space (notably FlexPrivacy, public & private transactions on the same blockchain, from the same wallet).

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Opacity (OPCT)? Opacity is a cloud storage provider with one major difference, privacy. With the rise of digital property, many people have increasingly become concerned with the security and privacy of materials stored with cloud storage companies such as Dropbox, Google, and others. Small businesses, individuals, and enterprises want to keep their data private.  Opacity protects people’s basic rights and provides private cloud storage to anyone through its Opacity token, OPCT. The token can be purchased on a crypto exchange and then used to purchase data storage plans that are completely private, and can only be accessed by the purchaser with the private key. Unlike other service providers, Opacity does not require personal identification information. Opacity stores no information on its users, and allows people to store private information, such as company secrets, intellectual property, personal photographs, legal documents, and family moments, with assurance that personal data stays personal. Access to private storage and file sharing enables a new way to protect your important files. Storing and sharing files has limitless potential, covering a wide variety of areas: Photos Videos Music Banking documents Legal documents File sharing with coworkers Enterprise cold storage Files can be shared privately or publicly, you decide! How Many Opacity Coins Are There in Circulation? Opacity tokens have a fixed maximum supply. This is set at exactly 130,000,000 OPCT and will never increase beyond this amount. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, this total supply has already been fully minted, with the majority already in active circulation.  What Makes Opacity Unique? Payments, accounts, and files are 100% private. All files are encrypted on the client and sliced into chunks for storage so no one can read them without the account handle. The files are not associated with the primary account holder, so even if a file were to be identified, it is not related to any other files. Zero knowledge means 100% protected! Easy to use for the average person! A developer can quickly build and launch their own dapp with the Opacity API. By creating your own dapp, you can earn OPCT from users that rely on your expanded platform capabilities. Larger enterprises can partner with Opacity to ensure private and encrypted data that can be used in the same way as existing systems. Node operators will be able to earn OPCT for hosting and managing the Opacity decentralized storage platform. Where Can I Buy Opacity (OPCT)? Opacity is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges, with BTC and ETH pairs currently available. Kucoin  and  Mercatox  both offer  Bitcoin  (BTC),  Ethereum  (ETH) pairs, as of November 2020. OPCT will be available on decentralized exchanges soon, such as  Uniswap .

TRON is up 4.49% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #27, with a live market cap of $7,690,284,257 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 71,659,657,369 TRX coins   and the max. supply is not available.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is TRON (TRX)? TRON is a blockchain-based operating system that aims to ensure this technology is suitable for daily use. Whereas Bitcoin can handle up to six transactions per second, and Ethereum up to 25, TRON claims that its network has capacity for 2,000 TPS. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Tron . This project is best described as a decentralized platform focused on content sharing and entertainment — and to this end, one of its biggest acquisitions was the file sharing service BitTorrent back in 2018. Overall, TRON has divided its goals into six phases. These include delivering simple distributed file sharing, driving content creation through financial rewards, allowing content creators to launch their own personal tokens and decentralizing the gaming industry. TRON is also one of the most popular blockchains for building  DApps . Who Are the Founders of TRON? TRON was founded by Justin Sun, who now serves as CEO. Educated at Peking University and the University of Pennsylvania, he was recognized by Forbes Asia in its 30 Under 30 series for entrepreneurs. Born in 1990, he was also associated with Ripple in the past — serving as its chief representative in the Greater China area. What Makes TRON Unique? TRON has positioned itself as an environment where content creators can connect with their audiences directly. By eliminating centralized platforms — whether they are streaming services, app stores or music sites — it is hoped that creators won’t end up losing as much commission to middlemen. In turn, this could also make content less expensive for consumers. Given how the entertainment sector is increasingly becoming digitized, TRON could have a headstart in applying blockchain technology to this industry. The company also says that it has a talented and experienced developer team, based around the world, that has been drawn from major companies such as Ripple Labs. Last but not least, whereas some other blockchain projects can be opaque about their plans for development, TRON offers a point of difference by delivering a roadmap that shows its intentions for the coming years.

How Many TRON (TRX) Coins Are There in Circulation? TRON has a total supply of just over 100 billion tokens — and at the time of writing, about 71.6 billion of these are in circulation. When a token sale was held in 2017, 15.75 billion TRX was allocated to private investors, while an additional 40 billion were earmarked for initial coin offering participants. The Tron Foundation was given 34 billion, and a company owned by Justin Sun got 10 billion. All in all, this meant that 45% of TRX supply went to the founder and the project itself, while 55% was distributed among investors. Critics argue that this is a much higher ratio than what has been seen with other cryptocurrency projects. How Is the TRON Network Secured? TRON uses a consensus mechanism that is known as  delegated proof-of-stake . TRX owners can freeze their cryptocurrency in order to get Tron Power, which means that they can vote for “super representatives” who serve as block producers. These block producers receive TRX rewards in exchange for verifying transactions, and these rewards are then distributed among the people who voted for them. According to TRON, this approach helps its blockchain to achieve higher levels of throughput.  Where Can You Buy TRON (TRX)? It is possible to  buy Tron  from dozens of the exchanges it is listed on - including Poloniex, Bancor, KuCoin, Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbene and others. However, it is not supported by Coinbase.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is TomoChain (TOMO)? Released in December 2018, TomoChain (TOMO) is a project that attempts to improve the scalability of the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain. This is primarily done via increasing its transactions per second (TPS) capacity.  The eventual goal of the project is to build a blockchain infrastructure for decentralized apps ( DApps ) and improve integration and security. TomoChain’s solution is to offer smart contract scalability, a task that requires solving how the blockchain can handle a higher number of transactions per second, exponentially increasing the utility of the smart contracts for real-world use cases and applications. Who Are the Founders of TomoChain? TomoChain was founded by Long Vuong, who is also the CEO of TomoChain Pte. Ltd.  Before that, he was the CEO of CityMe and a co-founder and project lead of the NEM ( XEM ) blockchain at Alternative Blockchain. He is an expert in the fields of blockchain and economics and has been an advisor to a number of blockchain projects in the past. What Makes TomoChain Unique? TomoChain has a range of unique features, such as its proof-of-authority consensus, the masternode system, 2-second confirmation, almost non-existent transaction fees, built-in exchange protocol, ICO smart contract templates, API support for token insurances and integrations and cross-chain transaction function without any fees between Ethereum and TomoChain.  The TomoChain mainnet was launched in 2018 and included proof-of-stake voting. The switch to masternodes made TOMO a mintable currency, and these masternodes participate in both creation and verification of the blocks. They are compensated for maintaining the network with minted TOMO. If a user wants to become a masternode candidate, they need to deposit 50,000 TOMO. Masternodes are allowed to eventually resign, but the deposited TOMO remains locked for 1,296,000 blocks after the resignation had been issued. Once a user becomes a masternode candidate, they need to become one of the top 150 voted candidates. If chosen, they will receive TOMO rewards in proportion to the number of blocks they manage to sign. As such, TomoChain provides a scalable blockchain that can be faster and has lower fees. TomoChain has a wide range of use cases.  TomoChain provides a general blockchain platform that allows for near-zero-fee and instant confirmation transactions, a proof-of-stake chain, staking as a voter and running a masternode.  It also offers the TomoZ or Zero Friction protocol that allows token holders to pay transaction fees in a token of their choice. Other services offered by TomoChain are Tomox and Relayers, which is a decentralized exchange protocol that allows businesses to make decentralized exchanges and landing platforms. TomoP is a privacy protocol that was developed on TomoChain to enable safe and untraceable transactions. Related Pages: Learn about  Badger DAO . Learn about  Utrust .

Tokenized stocks are tokenized derivatives that represent traditional securities, particularly shares in publicly firms traded on regulated exchanges. The key benefits of tokenized stocks include fractional ownership of traditional securities, 24/7 access to markets, and greater liquidity to name a few. These digital assets are backed 1:1 to traditional stocks, entitling holders to many of the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock. \n \nTokenized stocks are a tokenization of a digital total return swap contract (“TRS”) (similar to contracts for differences). The Tokenized stocks value is based on and collateralized with the underlying asset, a traditional security (typically a publicly traded equity) and the value of the digital asset is determined by the value of the traditional security. For example, they are collateralized by an equivalent notional amount of the traditional security (i.e., $100 of the debt derivative would be collateralized with $100 of the traditional security). This allows Tokenized stocks to mirror the economic performance of the applicable reference traditional securities.  Bittrex Global itself lists tokens that represent derivative contracts collateralized by the underlying traditional equities. These tokens are backed by shares of stock powered by DigitalAssets.AG. They cannot be withdrawn from Bittrex Global or redeemed for the underlying shares. In the future, there may be ways to withdraw the tokens from Bittrex Global or redeem the tokens for the underlying stocks. \n \nFor now, there are only spot markets for the tokenized stocks featured on Bittrex Global. Swiss-based DigitalAssets.AG facilitates the tokenization of traditional financial assets. The firm brought stocks trading to another major crypto exchange in cooperation with German based CM-Equity AG as recently as December of 2020.

DigitalNote describes itself as a decentralized Proof-of-Work(bmw512)/Proof-of-Stake(echo512) hybrid blockchain with fast, untraceable transactions and encrypted messaging features. The network is reportedly resistant to 51% attacks via its VRX v3.0 technology and it is mobile-ready with lightweight wallet functionality. A masternode network reportedly enhances untraceability and provides incentive for users to secure the network, whilst enabling fast private transactions and P2P messaging that are difficult to trace or censor. Miners and stakers are encouraged to participate via network fee payouts, facilitating consistent block generation and a fast network.  DigitalNote was originally released as \"duckNote\" by an anonymous individual or group of individuals under the pseudonym \"dNote\" in 2014. Over the years more advancements were added to the protocol, with each major upgrade rebranding the name of the protocol (first \"DarkNote\" and then ultimately \"DigitalNote\"). Much like Bitcoin's \"Satoshi Nakamoto\", the original founder(s) vanished in 2017, leaving the open source code to be updated by a community team who have since continued development.

Basic Attention Token is down 4.80% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #85, with a live market cap of $1,494,131,955 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 1,491,829,868 BAT coins   and a max. supply of 1,500,000,000 BAT coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Basic Attention Token , the top exchanges for trading in  Basic Attention Token  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   FTX ,    and   Huobi Global .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Basic Attention Token (BAT)? Basic Attention Token, or BAT, is the token that powers a new blockchain-based digital advertising platform designed to fairly reward users for their attention, while providing advertisers with a better return on their ad spend.  To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Basic Attention Token . This experience is delivered through the Brave Browser, where users can watch privacy-preserving adverts and receive BAT rewards for doing so. On the other hand, advertisers can deliver targeted ads to maximize engagement and cut down losses due to ad fraud and abuse. The Basic Attention Token itself is the unit of reward in this advertising ecosystem, and is exchanged between advertisers, publishers and users. Advertisers pay for their advertising campaigns in BAT tokens. Out of this budget, a small portion is distributed to advertisers, while 70% is distributed to users — whereas the intermediaries that typically drive up advertising costs are cut out of the equation to improve cost-efficiency.  Basic Attention Token launched in 2017 following one of the fastest sell-out initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) of all time, with the platform raising a total of $35 million in under a minute. Since then, it has rolled out its attention-based advertising experience to users in most countries through its Brave Rewards program.  As of November 2020, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada had the most active advertising campaigns. Who Are the Founders of Basic Attention Token? Basic Attention Token has two founders: Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy — two highly distinguished individuals in the internet browsing software industry.  Brendan Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, Inc — the parent firm behind the Brave browser and Basic Attention Token. Prior to his role at Brave, Eich was the founder and CTO of Mozilla and also invented JavaScript in 1995. He also helped launch one of the world's most popular web browsers in 2004 — Mozilla Firefox. Likewise, Brian Bondy joins as Brave's and Basic Attention Token’s CTO. Bondy is a heavily experienced engineer with previous experience working as a senior software engineer at Mozilla, software developer at Corel Corporation and software development lead at Khan Academy. Together, Eich and Bondy have a combined 50+ years of software development experience.  In total, the Basic Attention Token website lists 16 team members, many of whom have a development, engineering or research background. What Makes Basic Attention Token Unique? The primary use case for the Basic Attention Token is as a payment token for running advertising campaigns through Brave Ads. As of November 2020, advertisers must commit to a minimum ad spend of $2,500 per month to be able to launch their campaign, but a self-serve platform with potentially lower limits is currently in the pipeline.  Currently, this advertising budget must be paid entirely in Basic Attention Tokens, which advertisers can acquire from a variety of third-party exchange platforms. Out of this, Brave takes a small commission, and the rest is distributed to publishers and users.  One of the main distinguishing features about Basic Attention Token and the Brave Browser ecosystem is the capacity to reward (tip) users who are not yet part of the network — this includes both websites and individual Twitter users. These users can then securely register to the platform to collect any tips they have accumulated.  Both Basic Attention Token and Brave Browser have achieved significant user uptake since their launch. As of October 2020, Brave Browser has a total of 20.5 million active monthly users, whereas the Basic Attention Token is now held by a total of more than 368,000 unique wallets.

Meet  CoinMarketCap Alexandria  — the compendium of crypto knowledge. Get ahead of the market with the largest news, analyses, and updates with the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Basic Attention Token (BAT) Coins Are There in Circulation? Basic Attention Token has a maximum total supply of 1.5 billion  tokens . This cannot be increased without switching to a new token smart contract. Almost all of this supply is in current circulation. As a result, Basic Attention Token can be considered almost fully diluted.  In its 2017 ICO, a total of 1 billion BAT tokens were sold to investors, whereas the remaining 200 million tokens were locked in a development pool, and 300 million BAT was reserved for the user growth pool (UGP). As of November 2020, both the development pool and UGP pool addresses are nearly empty. How Is the Basic Attention Token Network Secured? Basic Network Token (BAT) is an  ERC-20 token . As such, it is built on the Ethereum  blockchain . Like any ERC-20 token, BAT is secured by a rigorously tested  proof-of-work  (POW) consensus algorithm supported by an extensive Ethereum miner network.  This  consensus  algorithm ensures only valid transactions are confirmed, while the combined work of the Ethereum mining network ensures BAT transactions are essentially irreversible once confirmed.  Where Can You Buy Basic Attention Token (BAT)? Basic Attention Token can currently be traded on the majority of popular cryptocurrency exchange platforms, and currently has excellent liquidity.  Binance , Coinbase Pro and  Huobi Global  count among the most reputable exchanges for BAT trades.  Like many cryptocurrencies, BAT can be  purchased directly using fiat  at a variety of brokers or can be traded against fiat assets on platforms like  Kraken  and Bithumb.

UNUS SED LEO is up 0.12% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #56, with a live market cap of $3,183,234,434 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 953,954,130 LEO coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  UNUS SED LEO , the top exchanges for trading in  UNUS SED LEO  are currently  OKEx ,   FTX ,   Gate.io ,   Bitfinex ,    and   BTSE .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is UNUS SED LEO (LEO)? UNUS SED LEO is a utility token that’s used across the iFinex ecosystem. The unusual name is based on a Latin citation from one of Aesop’s fables. The cryptocurrency allows Bitfinex users to save money on trading fees. The extent of the discount depends on how much LEO that the customer has in their account — and the savings on offer are spread across three tiers. There are fluctuations depending on whether a trading pair is crypto-to-crypto, or crypto-to stablecoin. UNUS SED LEO launched in May 2019 — and unlike many other cryptocurrencies out there, it is not designed to exist forever. Who Are the Founders of UNUS SED LEO? UNUS SED LEO was founded by iFinex after Crypto Capital, the company that processed its payments, saw part of its funds seized by the government. IFinex is the parent company of Bitfinex, which warned that it may not be possible to recover these funds. To cover the financial shortfall, it decided to launch the LEO token. To make good the money lost, iFinex unveiled plans to gradually buy back the token from investors until none are left circulating in the marketplace. A transparency initiative was also launched so the crypto community could monitor the initiative’s progress, and ensure it was meeting stated targets. What Makes UNUS SED LEO Unique?   A token burn mechanism means iFinex is committed to buying back UNUS SED LEO from the market on a monthly basis. The amount that’s purchased and burned is equal to at least 27% of the revenues generated by iFinex — and tokens are also purchased at the market rate. In a news release at the time, the company said: “The burn mechanism will continue until 100% of tokens have been redeemed.” Whereas some cryptocurrencies just launch on a single blockchain, LEO tokens were issued on two blockchains. While 64% of the original supply was on Ethereum, the remaining 36% could be found on EOS.

As we mentioned, the circulating supply of LEO tokens is designed to diminish over time. Originally, the total supply was set at 1 billion. LEO was sold for $1 apiece on a 1:1 basis with the Tether stablecoin, meaning that a total of $1 billion was raised over a 10-day period. There were 660 million ERC-20 tokens at launch, as well as 340 million EOS-based tokens — and Bitfinex allows conversions between the two chains to be made with ease. At the time, the company described the dual protocol launch as “unique” — and vowed that it would empower the Bitfinex community. How Is the UNUS SED LEO Network Secured? These tokens are based on Ethereum and EOS respectively. A dashboard has been released by Bitfinex that offers up-to-minute information on the current supply, and how many LEO tokens have been burned. Bar charts compare LEO burns on a daily basis. Where Can You Buy UNUS SED LEO? UNUS SED LEO is available on Bitfinex, Gate.io, OKEx and others. Common trading pairs connect LEO with the U.S. dollar, the USDT stablecoin, Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to minimize the volatility of the price of the stablecoin, relative to a certain stable asset or a basket of assets.  A stablecoin can be pegged to a cryptocurrency or flat money. In some cases, it can even be traded for commodities. Pax Dollar offers the advantage of transacting with blockchain assets through minimized price risk. The Pax Dollar tokens (USDP) are issued as  ERC-20 tokens  on the  Ethereum  blockchain and are collateralized 1:1 through the USD held in Paxos-owned US bank accounts. Who Are the Founders of Pax Dollar? The Pax Dollar was created by Charles Cascarilla and Rich Teo. Charles Cascarilla is the CEO and co-founder of Paxos. He is also the founding board member of the Association for Digital Asset Markets (ADAM), and a partner at Liberty City Ventures. He also co-founded and is a partner at Cedar Hill Capital Partners, and his past experience includes a portfolio manager at Claiborne Capital Management, financial analyst at Goldman Sachs and analyst at the Bank of America. Rich Teo is the second co-founder of Paxos. Before that, he worked as a principal/senior Analyst at Cedar Hill Capital Partners. He was also a financial analyst at Citi, and a combat signaler at the Singapore Armed Forces.  What Makes Pax Dollar Unique? The Pax Dollar is a stablecoin that allows any user to exchange U.S. dollars for the Pax Dollar Tokens. Its main goal is to stabilize the dollar with blockchain technology.  The Paxos company has a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services that allows them to offer regulated services within the crypto asset world. The token itself is backed by the USD in accounts that are held by the company at the U.S. depository institutions.

How Many Pax Dollar (USDP) Coins Are There in Circulation? Pax Dollar combines the U.S. dollar’s stability with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It is a digital dollar, and like other crypto assets can be moved instantaneously anywhere in the world throughout any time of the day. It is stable and is backed 1:1 for the dollar, as well as issued by the Paxos Trust Company. This means that the funds are carefully protected, audited and regulated. How Is the Pax Dollar Network Secured? The Pax Dollar (USDP) can be transacted over the Ethereum blockchain in the same way as  Ether  or any other  ERC-20  asset. If a user wants to redeem USDP, they can send tokens to an address controlled by Paxos that will destroy the tokens and transfer flat currency to the user’s bank account. Through this existence on a public blockchain, it can allow traders and exchanges to use USDP as an alternative to flat currencies and can help them outsource their banking requirements to Paxos. This also allows Paxos to easily be integrated with the Ethereum based applications easily. When there is a security threat, Paxos can pause transfers and approvals of the USDP Token. This ability to pause is controlled by a single owner role, such as OpenZeppelin’s ownable. The model follows OpenZeppelin’s Pausable. OpenZeppelin contracts help you minimize risk by using tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains.  Due to the fact that it has a regulated trust, Paxos can legally transfer assets and monies. Through combining that permission with blockchain technology, the transactions can be done rapidly, securely and with no risk.  Where Can You Buy Pax Dollar (USDP)? Pax Dollar or USDP can be purchased, sold and traded on several exchanges, those being:  Binance VCC Exchange Digifinex Bittrex Bithumb Global 1inch Exchange .

It has a circulating supply of 618,100,316 PNK coins   and the max. supply is not available.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Kleros (PNK)? Kleros (PNK) is a decentralized dispute resolution project that launched in July 2018. It is an open-source online dispute resolution protocol that uses blockchain and crowdsourcing to adjudicate disputes fairly. Kleros offers a middleman service for decentralized applications ( DApps ) and their users. If the service provided by the application does not create a dispute, Kleros acts as a trustless third-party service for payment.  When a dispute does occur, however, each party can apply for arbitration through the Kleros arbitrators that are selected from the owners of PNK tokens. PNK is an Ethereum-based  ERC-20  utility token with a fixed supply. At this point, the jurors can make a decision that will favor either party. The arbitration fees are distributed to all arbitrators in the form of ETH; jurors who have issued a minority decision lose part of their PNK tokens for the benefit of the majority of jurors. This decision can be appealed, at a cost. The stated mission of Kleros is to offer easier access to justice and improve individual freedom. Kleros charges a cost that is payable in ETH and is provided by the parties to the dispute or drawn from the funds previously locked in escrow. Who Are the Founders of Kleros? Kleros (PNK) was founded by Federico Ast, Clément Lesaege and Nicolas Wagner. Federico Ast is the CEO of Kleros and a lecturer on Coursera. Before that, he worked as a creator and evangelist at Crowdjury, and was a journalist, speaker, and blogger at Clarín.  Clément Lesaege is the CTO at Kleros. Before Kleros, he worked as a smart contract security freelancer and used to be a research intern in machine learning at Technicolor. Nicolas Wagner is the lead developer at Kleros. He also works as a freelance web and blockchain developer. In the past, Wagner worked as a blockchain developer at Dether.io and a back-end developer at Tradelab Programmatic Platform. What Makes Kleros Unique? Kleros is designed primarily for DApps, however, it is a decentralized and inexpensive arbitration system that could attract attention from outside of the blockchain industry. It is designed to be a multipurpose dispute resolution platform that can function as a legal adjudication service in many cases. This includes escrow dispute resolution, social network policy violations, and oracle resolutions. The PNK token plays an important role in all of these due to the fact that the amount which is deposited by jurors is directly correlated to the probability of them being selected for a case. It also functions as the economic incentive for jurors to be honest in cases. PNK also gives them voting power which is tied to the number of tokens they hold. This incentivizes owners to hold tokens for governance purposes, as jurors are also paid in ETH on a case-by-case basis in the form of arbitration fees.  Related Pages: Learn about  1inch . Learn about  Aave . Learn about data availability on  CMC Alexandria . Learn about the latest cryptocurrency news on the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Kleros (PNK) Coins Are There in Circulation? Kleros (PNK) has a circulating supply of 599,684,715 PNK as of February 2021, with no maximum supply data available at the time. How Is the Kleros Network Secured? Kleros relies on cryptography and blockchain for securing the evidence, selecting the jurors and incentivizing honest decisions. The protocol token represents the right of users to be drawn randomly as jurors. Since PNK is an ERC20 token, it can be stored on many offline or desktop crypto wallets that support Ethereum, allowing for a high level of security. Where Can You Buy Kleros (PNK)?

Tokenized stocks are tokenized derivatives that represent traditional securities, particularly shares in publicly firms traded on regulated exchanges. The key benefits of tokenized stocks include fractional ownership of traditional securities, 24/7 access to markets, and greater liquidity to name a few. These digital assets are backed 1:1 to traditional stocks, entitling holders to many of the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock. \n \nTokenized stocks are a tokenization of a digital total return swap contract (“TRS”) (similar to contracts for differences). The Tokenized stocks value is based on and collateralized with the underlying asset, a traditional security (typically a publicly traded equity) and the value of the digital asset is determined by the value of the traditional security. For example, they are collateralized by an equivalent notional amount of the traditional security (i.e., $100 of the debt derivative would be collateralized with $100 of the traditional security). This allows Tokenized stocks to mirror the economic performance of the applicable reference traditional securities.  Bittrex Global itself lists tokens that represent derivative contracts collateralized by the underlying traditional equities.

Tokenized stocks are tokenized derivatives that represent traditional securities, particularly shares in publicly firms traded on regulated exchanges. The key benefits of tokenized stocks include fractional ownership of traditional securities, 24/7 access to markets, and greater liquidity to name a few. These digital assets are backed 1:1 to traditional stocks, entitling holders to many of the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock. \n \nTokenized stocks are a tokenization of a digital total return swap contract (“TRS”) (similar to contracts for differences). The Tokenized stocks value is based on and collateralized with the underlying asset, a traditional security (typically a publicly traded equity) and the value of the digital asset is determined by the value of the traditional security. For example, they are collateralized by an equivalent notional amount of the traditional security (i.e., $100 of the debt derivative would be collateralized with $100 of the traditional security). This allows Tokenized stocks to mirror the economic performance of the applicable reference traditional securities.  Bittrex Global itself lists tokens that represent derivative contracts collateralized by the underlying traditional equities. These tokens are backed by shares of stock powered by DigitalAssets.AG. They cannot be withdrawn from Bittrex Global or redeemed for the underlying shares. In the future, there may be ways to withdraw the tokens from Bittrex Global or redeem the tokens for the underlying stocks. \n \nFor now, there are only spot markets for the tokenized stocks featured on Bittrex Global.

It has a circulating supply of 2,877,787 GDAO coins   and the max. supply is not available. What Is Governor DAO (GDAO)? Governor DAO (GDAO) is a decentralized autonomous organization that enables other projects and networks to adopt decentralized governance principles in their own token models and communities. In essence, this “DAO of DAOs” service encompasses several unique components that are accessible to both new and established projects alike.  These services include:\n* Proof-of-Existence Whitelist: A tokenized registry of provably unique Ethereum wallets any project can reference for sybil-resistant contracts. This can be used for voting, airdrops, token sales, and much more.\n* Metavoting: Clients allocate or lease project tokens to Governor DAO treasury so Governor community members collectively vote on their protocol with GDAO.\n* Contracts/Consultations: Projects leverage Governor DAO best practices, proprietary smart contracts, and mature voting community to help ensure their own ability to launch a working DAO, effective governance, fair token launch, etc. Governor DAO is a true DAO. Token holders retain full ownership of the project’s treasury reserves and revenue. Ultimately, further direction and build outs are determined by the token holders themselves. How Many GDAO Tokens Are There in Circulation? The total supply of GDAO is 2,921,625 (initially 3,000,000 with some amount of token burn). Of the total supply, 2,172,362 GDAO is in circulation (as of May 20, 2021). GDAO was a fair launch token. A significant portion of the supply was airdropped to token holders at time of the CBDAO exit scam in October 2020. The rest were allocated between liquidity programs, yield farming, and treasury reserves. No tokens were allocated for the team or for token sale. Who Are the Founders of Governor DAO? Governor DAO was created as a true, community initiative among token holders who were rugpulled by CoinBreeder DAO. The founders were token holders who believed strongly in the initial vision of the project (DAO of DAOs) and remained determined to build it out themselves. You can see some core members of the Governor DAO team  here . Because Governor DAO operates as a decentralized autonomous organization, there are over a dozen community members that play elevated “team roles” beyond the individuals listed on the website. Where Can I Buy Governor DAO (GDAO)? GDAO is primarily traded on  Uniswap v2 . It is additionally traded on  Gate.io  and  Bilaxy . New to cryptocurrency?

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Yearn.Finance (YFI)? Yearn.finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance ( DeFi ) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming. Its goal is to simplify the ever-expanding DeFi space for investors who are not technically minded or who wish to interact in a less committal manner than serious traders. Launched in February 2020, the service, formerly known as iEarn, has seen  huge growth  in recent months as new products debuted and developers released in-house token YFI. Who Are the Founders of Yearn.Finance? Yearn.finance is the brainchild of Andre Cronje. After leaving the iEarn project in February 2020, Cronje returned to oversee a rebirth, with new tools emerging and YFI going live in July. Since then, its fortunes have turned around, with assets under total value locked coming in at just over $1 billion as of the end of September 2020.  Cronje has a long career in cryptocurrency and has become synonymous with DeFi in particular. He also has positions at smart contract ecosystem Fantom and CryptoBriefing, a resource dedicated to initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) and crypto media. What Makes Yearn.Finance Unique? Yearn.finance set out to simplify DeFi investment and activities such as  yield farming  for the broader investor sector.  The platform makes use of various bespoke tools to act as an aggregator for DeFi protocols such as Curve, Compound and Aave, bringing those who stake cryptocurrency the highest possible yield. New features continue to be rolled out, these aiming, among other things, to help preserve the long-term value of the platform. Yearn.finance makes a profit by charging withdrawal fees, currently 0.5% at the end of September 2020, as well as 5% gas subsidization fees. Due to its governance model, these can technically be changed by consensus at any time.  The target market for yearn.finance is investors who do not have the time to study the increasingly complex DeFi phenomenon from scratch, or who wish to optimize their returns.

There was no premine upon launch in July 2020, and developers did not receive any starting funds: the total supply at launch was 0 YFI. Since then, the majority of the capped supply has entered circulation, and the success of the token is reflected in its all-time high price of $41,000, which it hit in mid-September 2020. YFI was also the first cryptocurrency to become worth more than Bitcoin ( BTC ) per unit. Users of yearn.finance earn YFI through providing  liquidity , while token holdings dictate governance privileges. How Is the Yearn.Finance Network Secured? Yearn.finance users can face a high risk of losing money thanks to market conditions changing rapidly and opportunistic entities attempting to profit from less-experienced participants. Cronje himself has sought to maintain transparency about the platform’s provenance, noting that even after code audits, yearn.finance could not be guaranteed to be 100% safe — DeFi involves inherent risk. Where Can You Buy Yearn.Finance (YFI)? YFI is a freely-tradable token, with pairs for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies all widely available.

Gala Games  aims to take the gaming industry in a different direction by giving players back control over their games. Gala Games mission is to make “blockchain games you’ll actually want to play.” The project wants to change the fact that players can spend hundreds of dollars on in-game assets, and countless hours spent playing the game, which could be taken away from them with the click of a button. It plans to reintroduce creative thinking into games by giving players control of the games and in-game assets with the help of  blockchain  technology. Players can own  non-fungible tokens  (NFTs) and influence the governance of games within the Gala Games ecosystem. The Founder’s Nodes voting mechanism allows players to influence what games Gala should develop and what games should get funding. Besides buying NFTs for specific games, Gala Games also utilizes GALA – its own utility token. So far, Gala Games has released one playable game –  Town Star  and an NFT collectible series –  VOX . It plans to release more games in the future, such as a fantasy RPG game, a sci-fi strategy game and a tower defense game. Since launching in 2019, Gala Games has grown to 1.3 million monthly active users, and 26,000 NFTs have been sold, with the most expensive piece valued at $3 million.  Who Are the Founders of Gala Games? Gala Games was founded by Eric Schiermeyer. He was the co-founder of Zynga, a popular social and mobile games company. Under Schiermeyer’s leadership, Zynga launched popular hits like Poker, Mafia Wars and Farmville. Schiermeyer, who has a reputation for working on the cutting edge of gaming, launched Gala Games in July 2019 to create a blockchain-based game network and give players more ownership of their games. In total, the Gala Games team consists of 60 employees. What Makes Gala Games Unique? Gala Games is not a single game, but rather it offers an entire array of different blockchain games that places fun first and blockchain in the background. Town Star, it's only currently playable game, is a town simulation that can be played in a browser. Players manage a town similar to the gameplay of SimCity, but in Town Star, they actually own the town. VOX is Gala Games’ set of collectible NFT avatars. Each VOX is unique and some VOXs are rarer than others. In the initial drop, 8,888 VOX were distributed for an average price of 0.0888  ETH , or roughly $280 at the time of writing. Although inspired by Town Stars, VOX has other utility besides just being an NFT avatar. Holders can lock up GALA, and earn VOXcoin by playing with their VOX avatars in the future. VOX owners also get their own FBX file, which allows them to animate their avatars, or even 3D print them in the future. Other games are in development as well. Fortified is a player-versus-player tower defense game set in a fantastical medieval world. Players will compete to build the best tower defense strategies.  Mirandus is a fantasy role playing game (RPG) set in a massive world ruled by five player-monarchs. Players will be able to own in-game assets and claim parts of the in-game landscape.  Echoes of Empire is a sci-fi strategy game set within a galaxy at war. Players will be able to own their own spaceships and control parts of the galaxy. Spider Tank Project is a multiplayer online battle arena game allowing players to pick a “spider tank” to battle other players. The game is free-to-play but will contain in-game earning mechanisms. It is scheduled for release in Q4 2021. A major component when it comes to developing these games is community feedback. Gala Games constantly engage and test assumptions with their community on Discord. This allows players to shape the direction and design of the games. Users can run  Gala Nodes , which supports the Gala network. In return, they receive rewards like GALA, limited edition NFTs and other opportunities. The Gala Node ecosystem consists of a triple-proof node system –  proof-of-work  (PoW),  proof-of-stake  (PoS) and proof-of-storage. PoW are called Founder Nodes, which are tier-1 nodes based on 50,000 fully-owned NFTs. These are early supporters of the network, and will receive NFTs from all subsequent games and GALA allocated to their node license. PoS are paid nodes that operate for specific games, through a smart contract “rental” structure. Proof-of-Storage are free nodes that will allow the games to be fully hosted on the node ecosystem, removing reliance on centralized hosting solutions like Amazon S3.

Learn how NFTs work in our  guide to Non-Fungible Tokens . Get the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the  CoinMarketCap blog . How Many Gala Games (GALA) Coins Are There in Circulation? The maximum total supply will be 35 billion GALA tokens. Currently, there is about 7 billion GALA in circulation.  17,123,286 GALA is distributed daily at approximately 0200 UTC. Half of this GALA is distributed to Founder’s Node operators, and half to the Gala Games conservatorship. Each year, on the 21st of July, the distribution of GALA will be halved. For example, beginning on July 21st of 2022, the daily distribution of GALA will be 8,561,643 instead of 17,123,286. The GALA token serves as a utility token that is used to purchase items in the game and can be earned from running a node. How Is the Gala Games Network Secured? The GALA token runs on  Ethereum  and the  Binance Smart Chain  (BSC) blockchain. The network is secured by its own set of nodes called Founder’s Nodes. Gala Games specifies a maximum of 50,000 Founder’s Nodes that validate in-game transactions and secure the network.  Nodes can also vote about which games are released to the Gala Games platform. You can operate a node by purchasing an account and running it on your computer. GALA are rewarded to node operators according to a point system. Running a node for a minimum of six hours in a cycle scores 1 point and referrals running nodes for at least six hours scores 0.1 points. At the time of distribution, all of the points are added up and the GALA is split between these points.  When Will Gala Games (GALA) Trading Begin? GALA token began trading in September 2020. Can Gala Games Hit $1? Gala Games is trading around $0.02 as of August 2021, so reaching $1 would require a 50X. Gala Games certainly has an interesting ecosystem of games and very experienced leadership, so even such an ambitious goal could happen in a few years.  Where Can You Buy Gala Games (GALA)? As of August 2021, you can buy GALA on  Sushiswap ,  Gate.io ,  Uniswap V3 ,  KuCoin  and  Bitrue .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Filecoin (FIL)? Filecoin is a decentralized storage system that aims to “store humanity’s most important information.” The project raised $205 million in an initial coin offering ( ICO ) in 2017, and initially planned a launch date for mid-2019. However, the launch date for the Filecoin mainnet was pushed back until block 148,888, which is expected in mid-October 2020. The project was first described back in 2014 as an incentive layer for the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer storage network. Filecoin is open protocol and backed by a blockchain that records commitments made by the network’s participants, with transactions made using FIL, the blockchain’s native currency. The blockchain is based on both  proof-of-replication  and  proof-of-spacetime . Who Are the Founders of Filecoin? Filecoin was founded by Juan Benet, who also created the Interplanetary File System. Benet is an American computer scientist who studied at Stanford University. After founding Protocol Labs in May 2014, he attended Y Combinator in the summer of 2014 with the intention of supporting both IPFS and Filecoin, as well as other projects. What Makes Filecoin Unique? Filecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner. Unlike cloud storage companies like Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare, which are prone to the problems of centralization, Filecoin leverages its decentralized nature to protect the integrity of a data’s location, making it easily retrievable and hard to censor.  Decentralized storage systems like Filecoin allow people to be their own custodians of their data, as well as makes the web more accessible to people worldwide. Since participating in the Filecoin network by mining and storing is directly related to winning more block rewards, Filecoin incentives participants to act honestly and store as much data as possible Related Pages : Check out CMC Alexandria’  deep dive into Filecoin . We’ve also prepared a  list  of the 5 things that decentralized storage aims to fix. See terms you don’t know? Check out our  glossary  on Alexandria. How Many Filecoin (FIL) Coins Are There in Circulation? Protocol Labs  describes  Filecoin’s tokenomics, or economic model, as a “market for data” where users can sell their storage space to other users, who are looking to rent. Five stakeholders will be able to trade tokens: developers, clients, miners, token holders and ecosystem partners. There will also be three Filecoin markets, according to Protocol Labs: file storage, file retrieval and on-exchange token trading.  In fall 2020, 400 miners participated in what was called the “Space Race” testnet phase, increasing Filecoin’s network data capacity by over 325 pebibytes; approximately 3.5 million FIL tokens will be released to the Space Race participants. How Is the Filecoin Network Secured? Filecoin is secured through proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime. In the Filecoin network, nodes that are also known as retrieval miners are in competition to serve clients with data as quickly as they can. They are then rewarded with FIL fees, which encourages a network of nodes that want to replicate and preserve files.  Storage miner nodes are constantly competing for contracts to provide storage to clients to a specific length of time. When a storage miner and their client agree on a deal, the storage miner holds the client’s data in a sector and “seals” it to create a unique copy of that sector’s data. Storage miners are rewarded with FIL by clients as deal fees, and these miners can also mine blocks and receive a block reward. Where Can You Buy Filecoin (FIL)? Ahead of the Filecoin mainnet launch,  Gemini  and  Kraken  have announced support for FIL.  Huobi  will list FIL after the mainnet goes live.

Wabi ecosystem connects Brands and Consumers, enabling a seamless, fair, and confidential exchange of value and information. Consumers participating in the ecosystem take advantage of the several tools designed to better inform their consumption choices and are incentivized with Wabi. Consumers redeem the tokens at a dedicated Marketplace where they can purchase thousands of unique products delivered to them from across the globe. Participating Brands leverage Wabi tokens to obtain unique datasets on consumer behaviour allowing them to make superior marketing and strategic decisions. Moreover, the Brands incentivise users with Wabi to generate new data, thus enabling rapid hypothesis testing and iteration. Effectively, Wabi taps into corporate marketing budgets ($1.6 – $1.9 trillion annually), making marketing a lot more efficient for participating companies. What makes Wabi Unique Full scope Agile Marketing Platform (Taeltech) For Consumer Brands, Wabi Ecosystem (branded “Taeltech Ecosystem for b2b clients”) offers a fully operational and comprehensive platform for Agile Marketing, enabling rapid data collection, hypothesis formulation, testing, and diagnostics. Wabi Ecosystem completely disrupts the way that new product development and marketing campaigns are done in FMCG and other industries by cutting down the idea-to-market feedback cycle from months to days. Consumer Packaged Products Database and Scanning utility Wabi team created one of the most comprehensive databases of packaged consumer products in the world. By scanning a barcode typically available on the outside packaging of everyday products, consumers are rewarded with Wabi and can immediately see: The Ingredients safety analysis Information on Nutritional Value (for food items) Manufacturer's business reputation and credibility Product Ratings, Reviews and Recommendations In exchange, the Ecosystem obtains a 360 degrees overview of a particular consumer's shopping habits and preferences, cutting across the shopping channels. Such insight into consumer behaviour is invaluable for researchers and marketeers. Wabi ecosystem is one of the very few providers of such data globally. Marketplace Wabi team built a Marketplace where consumers can redeem the tokens that they accumulated from various interactions in the Wabi ecosystem. There are currently thousands of products shipping directly to consumers from Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, etc. The Marketplace enables brands and manufacturers to list their products and access the 1 billion strong China market. Moreover, the Marketplace is equipped with the full suite of behavioural diagnostic tools that make it an excellent testing ground for brands wishing to enter the market or contemplating new product launches. What is WABI tokenomics? With growth of the ecosystem the circulating supply is reduced since for every point issued to consumers one WABI get taken out of the circulation. As of 16 November 2020, over 3,000,000 WABI have been locked out of circulation with growth of the WABI ecosystem. You can track the daily stats at www.wabi.io Who Are the Founders of WABI? Wabi was founded in 2013 by Alex Busarov and Yaz Belinskiy. The two founders first met in high school and after studying at the London School of Economics pursued careers in consulting at McKinsey and Bain respectively. Having worked on several important cases in the Consumer Goods industry, the two became convinced that there should be a more effective way to do marketing and that the inefficiencies in the FMCG industry that often resulted in public health risk were completely solvable with technology and determination.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What is KeeperDAO? KeeperDAO provides the infrastructure to make DeFi more secure, profitable and egalitarian through coordinating, capturing, and redistributing on-chain profit (MEV) back to users, protocols and Keepers. By attracting independent Keepers and coordinating their access to certain shared resources - namely various blockchain networks and settlement layers such as Ethereum - Keepers will be able to more efficiently capture on-chain profit - for example by executing an arbitrage or liquidation - and more fairly redistribute that profit to those that add value to the network - the users, protocols and Keepers - without it being destroyed through contention or the extraction of MEV. In addition to this, KeeperDAO designs and builds its own unique products for use by individual and institutional users, and routes the orders from these products through its community of Keepers for their exclusive execution. KeeperDAO calls these two strategies the  Coordination Game , and the  Hiding Game , respectively. The first increases Keepers' expected profitability by eliminating costly competition, and the second gives participating Keepers more opportunities to profit. Combined together, this creates the infrastructure for a more secure, fair and profitable financial ecosystem for both DeFi users and protocols. Because of their coordinating Keeper Economy they're not only able to provide the most complete MEV protection in DeFi, but by having integrated Keepers capture and redistribute the MEV back to their users and partnering protocols, KeeperDAO also in essence allows them to  get paid to play. How to use KeeperDAO? You can use  KeeperDAO's trading protocol  to place free limit orders on your favorite ERC-20 token pairs. If the order gets filled and it created an MEV-opportunity, you'll receive the captured MEV back in $ROOK. To deposit collateral and borrow from major decentralized lending protocols such as Compound and Aave, you can use KeeperDAO's new lending protocol, the  Hiding Vault . The Hiding Vault protects your position from liquidation on the open market by cloaking it, and uses the Just-In-Time-Underwriter (JITU) to buffer at risk loans. Besides their regular rewards, users will also receive a tertiary yield for having open loans in $ROOK. Exchanges, wallets, protocols and aggregators can read  here  on how they can integrate the Hiding Book and offer their users free and fully MEV-protected limit orders. They can also directly contact the team in their  Discord . To integrate as an independent Keeper, read the  Keeper Integration Guide .

Protocol engineer Lex Berezhny is responsible for the backend of crucial components such as the platform's wallets, protocol and blockchain. Brannon King is a senior blockchain engineer at Library Credit. Before joining LBRY, Brannon created software in such languages as C++ and C#.  What Makes Library Credit Unique? Library Credit uses the concept of a  decentralized  and  distributed network  (across several host computers) to build a content sharing crypto platform that offers a level playing field for all participants. It specifically seeks to solve some of the major problems (such as censorship, abuses of user privacy, unfair revenue sharing formula) that affect corporations that offer similar services.  The revenue generated from content consumers’ activity is fully credited to publishers in their preferred payment method — whether in LBC (the native token) or through third-party processors. Independent host providers can offer their computers’ processing power to earn a passive income on the platform. This mechanism is expected to make LBRY affordable and appealing to content creators.

How Many Library Credit (LBC) Coins Are There in Circulation? For the first 20 years of the project, one billion (1,000,000,000) LBC tokens are set to be in circulation. However, that figure will decrease gradually on an annual basis, with about a hundred thousand (100,000,000) for the first year. Additional reduction of the total supply will be incurred through bonus credits reserved for giveaway events, strategically meant to create initial public awareness.  See the full token allocation details below: 10% for partner organizations, charity firms and other strategic institutions. These include the EFF, ACLU and others with a strong reputation in advocating for digital rights, cybersecurity and the Internet's freedom. 20% for awareness programs. This allocation will be freely distributed at the early stage of the project to drive adoption among users. 10% for the team, to cover operational costs and team expenses (human capital management). 60% to be earned by the community via various activities, such as LBC mining. How Is Library Credit Network Secured? The network is secured via an end-to-end encryption technology that combines a  blockchain  model and DHT (distributed hash tables) data structure for encoding and retrieving data in a peer-to-peer exchange. Additionally, LBRY prioritizes each publisher's intellectual property rights by using a robust record management system. Additional measures such as hash modification, infringement penalties (defined in the DMCA) and processes that make infringements prohibitively expensive are continuously implemented to prevent other illegal activities.  To further prohibit intellectual property infringement, users are subjected to laws such as the DMCA. Where Can You Buy Library Credit (LBC)? LBC tokens are a critical component of the LBRY network. As such, the platform cannot operate without sufficient liquidity.  At the time of writing, LBC is traded against different currency pairs on  exchanges  such as: Upbit CoinEx Bittrex Hotbit For more info on how to buy LBC and other cryptos, see additional explanations  here .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Litecoin (LTC)? Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that was designed to provide fast, secure and low-cost payments by leveraging the unique properties of  blockchain  technology. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Litecoin . The cryptocurrency was created based on the  Bitcoin  (BTC) protocol, but it differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used, hard cap, block transaction times and a few other factors. Litecoin has a block time of just 2.5 minutes and extremely low transaction fees, making it suitable for micro-transactions and point-of-sale payments. Litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on Oct. 7, 2011, and the Litecoin Network went live five days later on Oct. 13, 2011. Since then, it has exploded in both usage and acceptance among merchants and has counted among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for most of its existence. The cryptocurrency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee, who intended Litecoin to be a \"lite version of Bitcoin,\" in that it features many of the same properties as Bitcoin—albeit lighter in weight. Who Are the Founders of Litecoin? As we previously touched on, Litecoin was founded by Charlie Lee, an early cryptocurrency adopter and a name held in high regard in the cryptocurrency industry. Charlie Lee, also known as “Chocobo,” is an early Bitcoin miner and computer scientist, who was a former software engineer for Google. In addition, Charlie Lee held the role of director of engineering at Coinbase between 2015 and 2017 before moving on to other ventures. Today, Charlie Lee is an outspoken advocate of cryptocurrencies and is the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation—a non-profit organization that works alongside the Litecoin Core Development team to help advance Litecoin. Besides Lee, the Litecoin Foundation also includes three other individuals on the board of directors: Xinxi Wang, Alan Austin and Zing Yang — all of which are accomplished in their own right. What Makes Litecoin Unique? Behind Bitcoin, Litecoin is the second most popular pure cryptocurrency. This success can be largely attributed to its simplicity and clear utility benefits. As of January 2021, Litecoin is one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies, and more than 2,000 merchants and stores now accept LTC across the globe. Its main benefit comes from its speed and cost-effectiveness. Litecoin transactions are typically confirmed in just minutes, and transaction fees are nearly negligible. This makes it an attractive alternative to Bitcoin in developing countries, where transaction fees may be the deciding factor on which cryptocurrency to support. In late 2020, Litecoin also saw the release of the  MimbleWimble  (MW) testnet, which is used to test Mimblewimble-based confidential transactions on Litecoin. Once this feature is available on the mainnet, Litecoin users will also benefit from greatly enhanced privacy and fungibility. Related Pages: Check out  Bitcoin (BTC)  — the original cryptocurrency.

Like most proof-of-work ( POW ) cryptocurrencies, the amount of Litecoin in circulation gradually increases with each newly mined block. As of January 2021, 66.245 million LTC have already been mined out of a total maximum supply of 84 million. The Litecoin Foundation recently estimated it will be well over 100 years until Litecoin reaches full dilution (around the year 2140) — since the number of LTC mined per block decreases every four years as part of the block reward halving schedule. Around 500,000 LTC was instamined on day one after the LTC genesis block was mined and Charlie Lee and presumably other early Litecoin developers were among the first miners. Despite this, as a fairly distributed asset, the Litecoin developers or Charlie Lee do not receive any direct profits from the operation of Litecoin—other than anything they may earn as part of the regular mining process. When Litecoin listed on several markets in 2011, the Litecoin price hit $0.30. Then, from November to December 2013, it went on a massive bull run, with Litecoin price hitting a high of $44.73. However, the bear market and  Mt. Gox hack  caused Litecoin prices to crash in 2014, and prices consolidated within the $2 to $4 range for several years. In November and December of 2017, Litecoin price rallied over 500% to $358.34, on the back of the crypto bull market. Litecoin price hit an all-time high in May 2021, in the latest crypto bull run, which saw it reach $386.45 on May 9, 2021. How Is the Litecoin Network Secured? As a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Litecoin is secured by incredibly strong cryptographic defenses — making it practically impossible to crack. Like Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin uses the PoW  consensus  algorithm to ensure transactions are confirmed quickly and without errors. The combined strength of the Litecoin mining network prevents double-spends and a range of other attacks, while ensuring the network has 100% uptime. Where Can You Buy Litecoin (LTC)? Litecoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies with a wide variety of fiat trading pairs, and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars (USD), Korean won (KRW), euros (EUR) and more when you  buy Litecoin . Some of the most prominent names include  Huobi Global ,  Binance ,  Coinbase Pro ,  OKEx  and  Kraken .

Arweave is up 38.36% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #63, with a live market cap of $2,741,775,848 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 33,394,701 AR coins   and a max. supply of 66,000,000 AR coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Arweave , the top exchanges for trading in  Arweave  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   FTX ,   Huobi Global ,    and   KuCoin .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Arweave (AR)? Arweave is a decentralized  storage  network that seeks to offer a platform for the indefinite storage of data.  Describing  itself as \"a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets,\" the network primarily hosts \"the permaweb\" — a permanent, decentralized web with a number of community-driven applications and platforms. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of  Arweave . The Arweave network uses a native  cryptocurrency , AR, to pay \"miners\" to indefinitely store the network's information. The project was first  announced  as Archain in August 2017, later  rebranding  to Arweave in February 2018 and officially  launching  in June 2018. Who Are the Founders of Arweave? Arweave was founded by Sam Williams and William Jones, two Ph.D. candidates at the University of Kent. Williams came to the project with experience in decentralized and distributed systems, having developed an operating system called HydrOS as a part of his studies, while Jones' focus was on graph theory and neural networking. While Williams dropped out of graduate school to focus on the company, Jones left the project early on in mid-2018 and completed his Ph.D. According to Williams, he came up with the idea while  walking  up a mountain in Scotland, later bringing the concept to Jones, with whom he developed the technical details. After launching Arweave, Williams was later named an advisor to Minespider, a company providing  blockchain -based supply chain tracking for the raw materials industry, and he has served as a mentor for the Techstars accelerator program. Although Arweave was founded with centralized leadership, it  launched  a  decentralized autonomous organization  in January 2020 comprised of core community members to further the development and expansion of the network and its ecosystem. What Makes Arweave Unique? According to its yellow paper, Arweave  seeks  to ensure the \"collective ability to store and share information between individuals and across time to new generations.\" In order to accomplish this goal, its flagship permaweb is built on top of Arweave's \"blockweave,\" a variation of blockchain technology in which each block is linked to both the one immediately prior and also a random earlier one. Arweave says this incentivizes miners to store more data because they need to be able to access random previous blocks to add new ones and receive rewards. Arweave is focused on building a sustainable ecosystem around the network. In June 2020, it  unveiled  \"profit sharing tokens,\" which allow developers to receive dividends when network transaction fees are generated from their application, and it  hosts  incubators to support the building of permaweb-based apps. The project also works with startups through its \"Boost\" program,  offering  free storage and access to the Arweave team and industry investors. In March 2020, Arweave  announced  that it had received $8.3 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Coinbase Ventures. This followed an earlier November 2019  investment  also from Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, as well as Multicoin Capital.

Keep up with the latest in technological innovations offered by blockchain with the  CoinMarketCap Blog . How Many Arweave (AR) Coins Are There in Circulation? According to its yellow paper, Arweave has a maximum token supply of 66 million AR. 55 million AR was minted when the blockweave's genesis block was created in June 2018, and an additional 11 million will be gradually introduced as block rewards. Arweave held a token pre-sale event in August 2017 in which 10.8% of the initially generated token supply was sold, and two public sales were  completed  in May 2018 and June 2018 in which 7.1% and 1.1% of the supply was sold, respectively. The company  allocated  an additional 19.5% for a private sale, 2.9% for project advisors, 13% for the team (subject to a five-year lock-up with 20% released per year), 19.1% for ecosystem development, and 26.5% for future project use (subject to a five-year lock-up with 20% released per year). How Is the Arweave Network Secured? The Arweave network is built on a modified version of blockchain technology it calls \"blockweave,\" which uses a \"proof-of-access\"  consensus  algorithm — a modified version of  proof-of-work . With PoA, each new block is not only linked to the one immediately prior to it but to a random previous block as well, and both blocks are hashed to generate the new one. Miners are not required to store an entire blockchain, but they are incentivized to store more information to prove they can access the old blocks that are required to mine a new one. The mining protocol used by Arweave, RandomX, was successfully  audited  by four cybersecurity firms — Trail of Bits, Kudelski Security, X41 D-Sec and QuarksLab — in August 2019. The project plans to utilize a new mining algorithm starting in early 2021 known as SPoRA, which it  said  in December 2020 had been audited by NCC Group. Where Can You Buy Arweave (AR)? AR can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as  MXC.COM ,  Bilaxy ,  Huobi Global , and  Hoo , among others. It can be traded against the stablecoin Tether ( USDT ) as well as  Bitcoin  (BTC) and  Ether  (ETH). Are you interested in buying AR or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin ?

Developers will also be able to interact with the RISE blockchain through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in multiple code languages such as TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, C# and JAVA. RISE claims to be one of the first blockchain projects to have its core codebase written in TypeScript. TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript used for large web development projects. Applications built on RISE will be distributed and decentralized, as a copy of the blockchain will reside on multiple nodes and if one node fails the network can still operate. DAPPs created with RISE development tools will run on RISE sidechains.  RISE Vision was incorporated as a business in Gibraltar as of December 2017.

Theta Fuel is up 1.44% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #74, with a live market cap of $1,909,198,923 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 5,301,214,400 TFUEL coins   and the max. supply is not available. If you would like to know where to buy  Theta Fuel , the top exchanges for trading in  Theta Fuel  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   Upbit ,   ZT ,    and   Gate.io .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Theta Fuel (TFUEL)? Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is one of the two native tokens on the Theta blockchain. TFUEL should not be mistaken for  Theta Token (THETA) , which is the governance token of the Theta blockchain supported by thousands of community-run Guardian nodes and its Enterprise validators including Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi and Samsung. TFUEL is the second token on the Theta blockchain that serves as the utility token in decentralized video and data delivery, it also acts as a  gas  token. This means that it is used to power all operations on the Theta blockchain, like payments to relayers for sharing a video stream, for deploying and interacting with smart contracts, and as fees associated with transacting NTFs and DeFi applications. In addition, it is also used to incentivize users in the ecosystem who share their redundant computing power as Edge Compute nodes as well as bandwidth resources as Edge Caching nodes for video streams and other data. Who Are the Founders of Theta Fuel? Theta Fuel, and in extension, the entire Theta Ecosystem, was co-founded by Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long in 2017. Liu has a long history in the gaming, video and virtual reality industries, co-founding video advertising firm Tapjoy, mobile social gaming startup Gameview Studios, and THETA.tv, the live streaming platform whose DApp was the first to be built on the Theta protocol. Jieyi Long is Theta’s second co-founder and CTO, following similar multi-year experience in design automation, gaming, VR, and large scale distributed systems. He authored multiple peer-reviewed academic papers and holds various patents in video streaming, blockchain and virtual reality.  Theta now has a modest team, and its official website lists strategic corporate investors as Samsung NEXT, Sony Innovation Fund, media investors BDMI Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, CAA Creative Artists Agency, and traditional Silicon Valley VCs including DCM, Sierra Ventures and the VR Fund. What Makes Theta Fuel Unique? Theta’s main use case is decentralizing video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants. The network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA) and Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy. Theta’s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen — video platforms — save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising, subscription revenues. Users have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens. The platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems. In addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) such as DeFi and NFTs on its fully featured EVM-compatible smart contract platform. How Many Theta Fuel (TFUEL) Coins Are There in Circulation? As earlier mentioned, there are two coins in the Theta ecosystem; THETA and TFUEL. Both coins are used as the main tools for interaction on the Theta blockchain, yet serve different functions. There are currently 5,232,675,200 TFUEL coins in circulation, which grows each year as new TFUEL is generated for staking rewards. Theta Tokens are fixed and at their max supply, which means there are 1,000,000,000 coins in circulation which will never increase. Theta runs on the proof-of-stake algorithm, which means staking is possible. Since the amount of THETA in circulation is the max supply there will ever be, TFUEL is the reward for staking on the network. To qualify for staking, you have to stake at least 1,000 THETA to a Guardian Node or run your own Guardian Node. How Is the Theta Network Secured? The Theta Blockchain relies on a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. It, however, adds a multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerance ( BFT ) consensus mechanism on its blockchain to achieve better security along with higher transaction throughput. At the time of Theta Mainnet launch in March 2019, Theta introduced Guardian Nodes. With the Guardian Node, no single entity controls the majority of THETA tokens being staked at any one time. This further helps the network achieve a high transaction throughput of 1000+ TPS. Theta uses a financial incentive scheme to ensure user participation in governance activities, and hence its network is secured by its own users.

The team claims that due to the absence of blocks and miners, access to Obyte ledger is decentralized, disintermediated, free (as in freedom), equal, and open. Obyte claims to be the first DAG-based cryptocurrency platform to support dApps. Due to the absence of miners and blocks, the team claims that there is no risk of front-running and other miner manipulation, and dApps are safer and easier to develop than blockchain-based dApps. DApps are developed in Oscript - a new language that avoids many unsafe programming patterns common in earlier dApp platforms. The team believes that Obyte is especially well suited for DeFi apps; some are already available on the platform, such as Bonded Stablecoins ( https://ostable.org ), while some are being developed. Other features include self-sovereign identity, private untraceable currencies, sending crypto to email using textcoins, and extremely small-footprint libraries suitable for small IoT devices.

A single vault that allocates capital across a range of farms. Allocations are governed by a DAO, where token holders vote to implement the best strategy available. What Are YAXIS Tokens? The YAXIS token serves as the governance token of the yAxis DAO.\nStakers play the role of a decentralised portfolio manager. This earns them a percentage of the yield farming profits from the vaults. How Does yAxis Work? The goal of yAxis is to create a yield portfolio which can obtain the best return by taking advantage of other existing yield aggregating platforms such as  Yearn Finance  or  Pickle Finance . yAxis operates above these platforms and can switch between deployed strategies in order to maximize yields.\nCurrently, the flagship product is the  stablecoin -based  MetaVault V2 . In the near-future MetaVault V3 with Canonical Vaults will support delegated strategies across BTC, ETH, LINK and more. Governance also plays a key role in determining how yAxis Project will launch new strategies and products.  MetaVault V2 The  MetaVault V2  is the current iteration of yAxis' flagship product. It allows users to deposit stablecoin assets in the form of USDT, USDC, DAI, and Curve 3pool (3CRV) into a single vault. The 3CRV is then invested in various yield farming opportunities on behalf of the user.\nWhenever there is a better strategy available, MetaVault will convert the underlying deposits into the appropriate asset to begin yield-farming using the more profitable strategy. Users can choose to withdraw their funds anytime by withdrawing their stablecoin and claiming their YAXIS rewards.  MetaVault V3 with Canonical Vaults The imminent MetaVault V3 product will allow users to deposit a wide range of digital assets such as BTC, ETH, LINK, into a series of Canonical Vaults. This planned upgrade of MetaVault will include a basket of diverse, risk-weighted strategies for each digital asset.  Governance Strategies are decided by the community by staking YAXIS tokens on the governance platform. YAXIS holders can choose from a preselected list of yield farming aggregators, and stake their tokens in the contract which they believe will provide the best return.\nStrategy risk, fees, and the overall DeFi market sentiment will be displayed on the governance user interface. In return for voting, the community will reward voters with a share of the MetaVault’s performance fee. How Can I buy YAXIS? YAXIS can purchased at the following  cryptocurrency exchanges :\n Uniswap   1inch \nYou can also earn YAXIS through the  staking section  on the yAxis platform. Users can stake their existing YAXIS to earn a share of farming rewards.\nUsers may also provide liquidity for the YAXIS-ETH pair on Uniswap. LP Tokens (Liquidity Provider) can then be staked on the YAXIS app to earn additional YAXIS rewards.

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is DIA (DIA)? DIA (Decentralised Information Asset) is an open-source oracle platform that enables market actors to source, supply and share trustable data. DIA aims to be an ecosystem for open financial data in a financial smart contract ecosystem, to bring together data analysts, data providers and data users. In general, DIA provides a reliable and verifiable bridge between off-chain data from various sources and on-chain smart contracts that can be used to build a variety of financial  DApps . DIA is the governance token of the platform. It is currently based on  ERC-20  Ethereum protocol. The project was founded in 2018, while the token supply was made available to the public during the bonding curve sale from Aug. 3 through Aug. 17, 2020, where 10.2 million tokens were sold. Who Are the Founders of DIA? The DIA association was co-founded by a group of a dozen people, though Paul Claudius, Michael Weber and Samuel Brack are the leaders. Claudius is the face of the project and its lead advocate, sometimes also mentioned as a CBO. He has a masters degree in international management from ESCP Europe and a bachelors in business and economics from Passau University. Apart from working on DIA, he is also a co-founder and CEO of BlockState AG and c ventures. Before crypto, he had worked as director for a nutrition company called nu3. Weber is the project's CEO. He holds a asters in management from ESCP Business School and an equivalent to a bachelors in economics and physics from University of Cologne.  He has worked in several banks and financial institutions before turning to crypto, where he founded such projects as Goodcoin, myLucy and BlockState.  Samuel Brack serves DIA in the role of CTO. Like both Claudius and Weber, he shares the same position at BlockState. He has a masters degree in computer science from Humboldt University of Berlin, where as of January 2020, he is still studying for his PhD. What Makes DIA Unique? DIA aims to become the Wikipedia of financial data. It specifically addresses the problem of dated/unverified/hard to access data in the world of finance and crypto, especially  DeFi , while proposing to solve it viaa system of financial incentives for users to keep the flow of open-source, validated data streams to the  oracles  up and running. The current design of oracles, DIA argues, is non-transparent, difficult to scale and vulnerable to attack. The DIA governance token will be used to fund data collection, data validation, voting on governance decisions and to incentivize the development of the platform. Users can stake DIA tokens to incentivi`e new data to appear on the platform, but access to historical data though DIA is free.

Learn more with  our glossary . Ready for more? Check out our  blog  for the latest crypto news and insights. How Many DIA (DIA) Tokens Are There in Circulation? The total DIA token supply is limited with 200 million coins minted. 10 million tokens were initially sold at a private sale, 19.5 million are with early investors and advisors, Outlier Ventures being the largest. 30 million coins were offered for a bonding curve sale in August 2020, out of which 10.2 million were sold to the public, and the remaining 19.8 million burned. Another 24 million tokens are allocated to founders and team with a 29 month vesting period, and 25 million locked for the future use for the development of the DIA ecosystem. Finally, 91.5 million DIA tokens are in the company's reserve to be unlocked in equal parts over 10 years every December. Out of the first unlocked part, half of the tokens were burned in an instant, after the community vote makes the decision. It is planned that smart contracts using DIA oracles will be receiving DIA Governance Tokens on a daily basis through what they call “proof-of-use” and “proof-of-truth” mechanisms. How Is the DIA Network Secured? DIA is a standard  ERC-20  token, meaning it requires Ethereum to function, inheriting all its strengths and weaknesses. The Ethereum network is one of the largest and thus strongest because of its decentralization, as all transactions are protected by the Ethash  proof-of-work  function. ERC-20 merely defines a set of rules for tokens to operate on. Downsides of Ethereum may be noticeable: for example, congestion can hike the price of  gas  needed to perform transactions, leading to delays and abnormally high transaction fees, which impact all participants. Where Can You Buy DIA (DIA)? DIA is a freely-tradable token. Pairs available for trading include BTC, USDT and ETH The top exchanges for trading in DIA are currently  Binance ,  OKEx ,  HBTC ,  Bidesk , and  BiKi .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is ShareToken (SHR)? ShareToken is a digital utility token that is used to make payments for sharing services across industries and geographies on the ShareRing platform — which includes the ShareRing application, ShareRing shop and each user’s ShareRing ID.  ShareRing is an open-source  blockchain -based platform that makes use of distributed ledger technology and a dual token mechanism.  According to the developers and founders of the ShareRing platform, the current service sharing economy is incredibly fragmented and multi-faceted, which can be overwhelming for consumers. The use of ShareToken on the ShareRing platform overcomes this issue by offering a single decentralized marketplace and digital currency that lets you securely access services around the world and pay for them.  In 2019, the creators of the platform and its corresponding digital currency turned their focus to the travel industry and created TravelRing — the first B2B consumer-first example of what is possible using the ShareRing platform. Besides being used to pay for transaction fees on the ShareRing network, SHR tokens can also be  staked  to earn rewards, known as flowbacks.  Who Are the Founders of ShareToken? ShareRing (and by extension the ShareToken) was co-founded by six individuals: Tim Bos, Rohan Le Page, Peter David, Neville Christie, Jane Sadler-Kidd and Barry Brewster. Bos, David, Christie, Sadler-Kid and Brewster were already working on developing a car-sharing and rental technology provision solution long before ShareToken and ShareRing came into existence. They were already experimenting with making shared services more accessible. The creation of this white-label car-sharing solution called Keaz meant that the founders had familiarized themselves with what was needed to help consumers take advantage of specialist software for car-pooling, ride-hailing, and vehicle rentals. Rohan Le Page, on the other hand, has an extensive history in the automotive industry, and served as ShareRing's chief operating officer until June 2020.  The rest of the ShareRing team hails from a wide range of disciplines and includes a mix of developers, engineers, designers, marketing experts and more. What Makes ShareToken Unique? ShareRing was one of the first platforms to implement an innovative dual token mechanism—these tokens are ShareToken (SHR) and SharePay (SHRP).  ShareToken is the utility currency that is used in the ShareRing ecosystem. Meanwhile, SharePay is a stablecoin that is used to make payments for sharing services through the ShareRing platform.  SHRP is used as payment for goods and services between the user and the service provider. The use of SharePay effectively minimizes the cryptocurrency-related complexity on the platform, reducing the number of friction points for inexperienced cryptocurrency users.  Meanwhile, ShareToken is used to power the ShareRing ecosystem and decentralized ledger, since service providers need to use SHP tokens to pay their transaction fees.  Both digital currencies work in concert to allow consumers to make the most of the ShareRing platform. The founders of the platform want ShareRing to be the “amazon of the service industry,” that is, a one-stop solution for accommodation, transport and miscellaneous activity services where there is no middleman and therefore no additional costs.

How Many ShareToken (SHR) Coins Are There in Circulation? As of January 2021, there are 2.12 billion ShareTokens in circulation. This is out of a maximum possible supply of 4.4 billion SHR.  When the ShareToken first launched in late 2019, it had an initial circulating supply of 1.97 billion tokens. According to the ShareRing website, the initial supply of SHR was segmented as follows:  Cornerstone investors - 31% Private Equity Investors/Institutional Investors - 1% ICO - 11% Core team - 11% Airdrop - 1% Operations (frozen tokens) - 45% All team members have agreed to lock up their tokens, and now require approval from the ShareRing board if they wish to sell more than 10% of their SHR. How Is the ShareToken Network Secured? The ShareToken was initially launched as an  ERC-20  token on the Ethereum blockchain, but migrated to the BEP2 standard in July 2019, with the launch of ShareToken on  Binance  Chain.  As a BEP2 token, ShareToken is secured by the underlying Binance Chain, which uses a Tendermint  BFT  and delegated proof-of-stake ( dPOS )  consensus mechanisms  to protect it against a range of  attacks .  Where Can You Buy ShareToken (SHR)? ShareToken is a moderately  liquid  token that is available to trade on almost a dozen exchange platforms. Centralized exchange options include Bilaxy, KuCoin, Bithumb Global, whereas decentralized exchange ( DEX ) options include  Uniswap  (ERC-20 SHR only) and the Binance DEX. As of January 2021, ProBit Exchange is the only platform with an SHR to fiat trading pair (SHR/KRW). Read more about buying cryptocurrencies with your credit or debit card  here .

Fusion (FSN) bills itself as an all-inclusive blockchain-based financial platform that offers cross-chain, cross-organization, and cross-data source services through smart contracts. The project uses the Hierarchical Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (HHCM), which amalgamates elements from PoW, PoS, and parallel computing with the goal of creating an efficient and safe platform.  Notably, Fusion leverages what it dubs 'Distributed Control Right Management' as a security layer that protects cryptoassets on the Fusion blockchain. The distributed storage and sharding of a private key ensures means that no single node can gain control of assets.  Fusion also provides for multiple triggering modes, such as time and event-based triggers, into its smart contracts, which were designed to meet the demands of complex financial smart contracts.  Fusion is led by Dejun Qian, who also founded BitSE, a blockchain incubator that facilitated the rise of VeChain and QTUM.

A standard for tokenizing on-chain collateral Saffron is a protocol for tokenizing on-chain assets, including contracts that otherwise impair access to utilized capital. Tokenized ownership of on-chain assets gives liquidity providers greater flexibility and uninterrupted access to their underlying collateral while enabling leveraged staking and bespoke risk management. Peer to peer risk exchange Existing decentralized earning platforms expose liquidity providers to complex code driven outcomes. Network participants must evaluate an array of catastrophic scenarios where the resulting state could wipe out their holdings or lead to significant impermanent loss. It is hard to anticipate the net effect of extreme market volatility or focused economic attacks. Saffron narrows the set of possible outcomes by giving liquidity providers dynamic exposure. Dynamic exposure The first application of Saffron gives liquidity providers the option to select customized risk and return profiles via the use of Saffron pool tranches. Saffron separately tokenizes the future earning stream and the net present value of utilized principal in each tranche. Earnings, based on tokenized holdings, are distributed accordingly across all tranches via payback waterfalls. Payback waterfall The initial application of the payback waterfall is split between two primary tranches.\n-A yield enhanced “A” tranche.\n-A risk mitigated super-senior “AA” tranche. Added liquidity, when removed, is used to pay back the initial principal of AA holders before paying the principal and interest of the yield enhanced A tranche. In exchange for this enhanced return, participants of the A tranche must stake Saffron’s native tokens (SFI) to mitigate against failures on the underlying platform (such as Compound, Aave, or Curve). The Saffron protocol in this scenario acts as an escrow service for transfer of risk between A tranche participants and AA tranche participants. Saffron also includes an “S” tranche for allocating liquidity efficiently as it is needed based on a tranche balancing algorithm.

Zilliqa is down 4.05% in the last 24 hours.   The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #88, with a live market cap of $1,319,142,732 USD.   It has a circulating supply of 11,951,020,601 ZIL coins   and a max. supply of 21,000,000,000 ZIL coins. If you would like to know where to buy  Zilliqa , the top exchanges for trading in  Zilliqa  are currently  Binance ,   Mandala Exchange ,   OKEx ,   FTX ,    and   Huobi Global .   You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is Zilliqa (ZIL)? Zilliqa is a public, permissionless  blockchain  that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The platform is home to many  decentralized applications , and as of October 2020, it also allows for  staking  and  yield farming . Development work officially started on Zilliqa in June 2017, and its testnet  went live  in March 2018. A little over a year later, in June 2019, the platform  launched  its mainnet. The native utility token of Zilliqa, ZIL, is used to process transactions on the network and execute smart contracts. Who Are the Founders of Zilliqa? Zilliqa was first conceived by Prateek Saxena, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore School of Computing. Saxena and several students in the School of Computing published a paper in 2016 that outlined how a sharding-focused blockchain could improve network efficiency and speed. Around the same time, Saxena co-founded Anquan Capital alongside Max Kantelia, a lifelong finance and tech entrepreneur, and Juzar Motiwalla, former president of the Singapore Computer Society. The company incorporated Zilliqa Research in June 2017 to develop the Zilliqa network, bringing on Dong Xinshu as its CEO, Yaoqi Jia as its chief technology officer and Amrit Kumar as its chief scientific officer. All three previously worked as research fellows at the NUS School of Computing. What Makes Zilliqa Unique? Zilliqa  claims  to be the world's first public blockchain to rely entirely on a sharded network. This allows it to achieve high throughput and a high rate of transactions per second, which it says solves the scalability issue. Because each shard processes transactions individually, as the network grows and the number of shards increases, the number of transactions that can be processed per second also increases. As well, records are immediately added to the Zilliqa blockchain after being processed, meaning that no additional time for confirmation is required. Zilliqa seeks to become the blockchain of choice for large-scale enterprise use, including among the advertising, gaming, entertainment and financial services and payments industries. In its 2018 position paper, its team  states  that the platform \"aims to rival traditional centralized payment methods such as VISA and MasterCard.\" Both Anquan Capital and Zilliqa Research, the company responsible for developing Zilliqa, hold significant reserves of ZIL. As of 2021, the Zilliqa network is an active network that runs over  millions of transactions  each month. The blockchain has also been constantly scaling, going from averaging over 900 blocks produced a day when its main net launched to presently producing  over 2500 blocks  a day.

How Many Zilliqa (ZIL) Coins Are There in Circulation? Zilliqa has a fixed maximum supply of 21 billion tokens. ZIL was first  made available  for sale as an  ERC-20  token as a part of a token generation event that concluded in January 2018. The tokens were subsequently transferred to the Zilliqa mainnet in a token-swap event that  concluded  in February 2020. Before launching, Zilliqa generated 60% of all tokens (12.6 billion ZIL) to be distributed at the token generation event, and the remaining 40% (8.4 billion ZIL) will be created through the mining process. Ten percent of all tokens (2.1 billion ZIL) were reserved for Anquan Capital, 12% (2.52 billion ZIL) for Zilliqa Research, and 5% for contemporary and future Zilliqa team members — all of which were announced to be distributed quarterly over a three-year period. Zilliqa is designed such that all tokens will be mined within 10 years, with the block mining reward slowly decreasing. According to its  whitepaper , the project  aims  to have 80% of the tokens (16.8 billion ZIL) mined within the first four years and 20% (4.2 billion ZIL) in the remaining six years. How Is the Zilliqa Network Secured? The Zilliqa network is secured through a practical  Byzantine Fault Tolerance , or pBFT,  consensus  protocol, meaning that at least two-thirds of all nodes must agree that a record is accurate in order for it to be added to the blockchain. Each Zilliqa blockchain shard relies on a group of nodes to confirm a subsection of all the transactions, and once each shard has reached a consensus, a second group of nodes confirms the shards' collective results and adds a new block to the blockchain. The network uses elliptic-curve cryptography to secure its consensus protocol and allows for multisignatures. In addition to the pBFT consensus protocol that secures its transaction records, Zilliqa also uses a  proof-of-work  algorithm to assign node identities and generate shards. Zilliqa  developed  a new language, Scilla, for its  smart contracts . Short for Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language, Scilla is a safety-focused language intended to automatically identify and eliminate security vulnerabilities at the language-level and make it easier to formally verify the safety of smart contracts through mathematical proofs. Where Can You Buy Zilliqa (ZIL)? Zilliqa's native token, ZIL, is listed on several major  cryptocurrency  exchanges — including  Binance ,  Huobi ,  Bitfinex  and Bithumb — where it is available to be traded against fiat currencies,  stablecoins  and other cryptocurrencies. Are you interested in buying ZIL or other cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin  (BTC)? CoinMarketCap has a simple,  step-by-step guide  to teach you all about crypto and how to buy your first coins.

According to the company  whitepaper , there is a maximum supply of 100 billion DENT tokens. The total circulating supply at the time of writing is 93,690,412,211 DENT tokens.  Of the total supply, 8.6 billion DENT tokens were sold at a fixed price of $0.0005 per token during the company’s initial coin offering ( ICO ). 30% of all DENT tokens remain at the company for strategic acquisitions and market seeding, user incentives, salaries and bonuses. The remaining 70% of the token supply was released during pre-sale and sale events, and any outstanding tokens were locked up and released quarterly after that.  How Is the Dent Network Secured? DENT is an  Ethereum  based  ERC-20  token. This means that the Dent platform operates thanks to the proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus method. Unlike  Bitcoin , which utilizes the proof-of-work ( PoW ) consensus mechanism, Dent relies on large stakeholders to become nodes and transaction validators.  The benefits of PoS consensus mechanisms are many, but the most prominent include increased scalability and reduced electrical and computing power consumption. Considering this, many platforms are looking to utilize the Ethereum blockchain to launch their products. Dent is one of the pioneer projects to launch an ERC-20 token back in 2017.  Where Can You Buy Dent (DENT)? DENT coins are relatively accessible for purchase, being ERC-20 tokens. One of your solid choices is  Binance , which has the largest trade volume of DENT coins as of April 2021. Another option to purchase DENT tokens is  KuCoin .

You can find others listed on our  crypto exchanges page . What Is FTX Token (FTT)? FTT is the native cryptocurrency token of the crypto derivatives trading platform FTX that launched on May 8, 2019. The team behind FTX comprises some of the largest crypto traders over the past few years who, having found issues with most mainstream crypto futures exchanges, decided to launch their own platform. FTX claims that it stands out due to such features as clawback prevention, a centralized collateral pool and universal stablecoin settlement. In regards to clawback prevention, a significant amount of customer funds on other derivative exchanges have been claimed by socialized losses. FTX reduces this by using a three-tiered liquidation model. On existing crypto futures exchanges, the collateral is fragmented across separate token wallets; this can be difficult for traders as it prevents positions from getting liquidated. On the other hand, FTX derivatives are stablecoin-settled and only require one universal margin wallet. Another feature of the FTT are leveraged tokens, which allow traders to put leveraged positions without the need to trade on margin. If a trader wants to short Bitcoin with 3x leverage, they can simply buy a 3x short Bitcoin leveraged token on FTX. These tokens are  ERC20 -compatible and can be listed on any spot exchange. FTX currently offers  XRP ,  BNB ,  TRX ,  BTC ,  ETH ,  EOS ,  USDT  and  LEO  leveraged tokens. Who Are the Founders of FTX Token?

Bankman-Fried studied physics and has a bachelor’s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Gary Wang is the co-founder and chief technology officer at FTX: Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange. He is also the chief technology officer at Almeda Research. Before this, he worked as a software engineer, after moving up from a software engineering intern at Google. He was also a software engineer intern at Facebook.  He has a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. What Makes FTX Token Unique? FTX is backed by Almeda Research, which is known as one of the leading companies in crypto trading and one of the largest liquidity providers. As such, FTX is a product designed by professionals with confirmed expertise in the industry. They cover multiple services: from collateral to maintenance margin to liquidation processes and product listing.

Launched in 2011 by Pixowl, The Sandbox is a  blockchain -based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community. According to the  official whitepaper , the Sandbox platform’s main mission is to introduce blockchain technology in mainstream gaming successfully. The platform focuses on facilitating a creative “play-to-earn” model, which allows users to be both creators and gamers simultaneously. The Sandbox employs the powers of blockchain technology by introducing the SAND utility token, which facilitates transactions on the platform.  Who Are the Founders of The Sandbox? Arthur Madrid  is co-founder and CEO at Pixowl, and he is one of the driving forces behind The Sandbox. He graduated with a degree in economics from Université Paris Dauphine in 2000. Madrid’s professional career began as a consultant for Eurogroup Consulting France, but he soon found his entrepreneurial spirit. In 2001, he founded 1-Click Media, which was later purchased by Ipercast.  Sebastien Borget  is also a co-founder at Pixowl and serves as the COO of the company. He graduated with a degree in computer systems networking and telecommunications from Institut national des Télécommunications in 2007. His professional career began as a project lead for 1-Click Media, and since then, Arthur Madrid and Sebastien Borget have been an entrepreneurial duo. They founded Pixowl in 2011 and have been continually working on projects together. What Makes The Sandbox Unique? The Sandbox is a unique platform because it introduces blockchain technology to the world of gaming. The gaming industry is a huge untapped market when it comes to the adoption of blockchain tech, and Pixowl saw that in 2011. By creating a universe where gamers can create and collect blockchain-based assets, the Sandbox aims to revolutionizes the market. It makes a niche for itself in the global market of gaming.  By focusing on user-generated content, the Sandbox creates a metaverse of involved players who contribute to the platform’s further development. Not only that, by introducing the SAND token, the Sandbox promotes decentralized governance and allows users to share their views and ideas about the development of the project.

The founders and team members secured about 31% of the total token supply distributed among them. Around 12% of the total supply were set aside for a dedicated Binance Launchpad Sale, and another 10% were dedicated as rewards to advisors on the project.  How Is The Sandbox Network Secured? As the Sandbox virtual world is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, it is secured by the proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism. The SAND token is a standard version  ERC-20  token, which means owners can stake it and benefit from staking rewards.  Unlike the proof-of-work ( PoW ) consensus mechanism employed by the Bitcoin blockchain, PoS does not require vast amounts of electrical or computing power to validate transactions. It relies on stakeholders with the largest holdings in SAND tokens. The PoS consensus mechanism allows for a lot of diverse applications while still ensuring the security of staked funds.  Where Can You Buy The Sandbox (SAND)? The Sandbox is enjoying a rise in interest from both investors and users, and more exchanges have started offering trades with the SAND token.

OASISBloc, a data trading platform among diverse businesses and industries, was launched by OASISBloc Foundation based in Singapore in October 2018. The platform main-net was completed in August 2019 after successfully developing MVP and test-net. In October 2020, OASISBloc released its latest version of whitepaper (v.0.7.1) and business roadmap on the website.  One of the key features of OASISBloc is its inter-chain, which connects the domain chain of each industry. Interconnection of user accounts, data transaction history, and domain chain history interconnected to OASISBloc are all recorded and managed through OASISBloc, which turns data generated by each user into a standardized and valuable data. With these features, OASISBloc participants will be able to trade practical data to achieve mutual benefits. Another key feature of OASISBloc is its self-developed ePoA (equitable Proof of Authority), and this consensus algorithm was designed to supplement the weak points of PoA where certain parties might be able to have too much authority. Regarding block generation, OASISBloc has a witness group that consists of 39 candidates for block generators, and this witness group is broken down into three levels, each of which selects the final block generator at random. Block generators generate and validate blocks for a swift and accurate recording on block every time there is a transaction of data trading, which exchanges value between domain chains. OASISBloc’s consensus algorithm, ePoA, keeps the block generation process and history transparent, allowing anyone to experience the irreversibility of transaction and block validation.

The team is currently prepared for two initial use cases – asset price tracking and eSports betting. Oracle Nodes: Oracle Nodes are community-run nodes that monitor data and relay it back to the blockchain. Equilibria uses a built-in incentive system to encourage good-actors to run Oracle Nodes that feed data to the blockchain, and help prevent bad actors from participating in the network. Anyone can start a node, and all oracle node holders are rewarded with a portion of the total block reward and any fees generated from an oracle cluster. The team will build a number of oracle clusters to make it easy for other blockchains to integrate Equilibria Oracle Nodes. Oracle Clusters: The primary use for Equilibria Oracle Nodes is to strengthen other projects by removing unnecessary centralization from their dApps and/or network. The team will build oracle clusters that make it easy to integrate Equilibria Oracle Nodes into any privacy-focused project.\nThe team will also create our own dApps that utilize oracle nodes and are built directly into the blockchain. Only the most trusted and secure data sources will be used to ensure high-quality data and 100% uptime. Currently, there are two planned oracle clusters but more may be added in the future.

BEAM is a confidential decentralized finance ( DeFi ) platform that runs on a combination of two blockchain protocols (LelantusMW and Mimblewimble).  In the early years of the industry, transactions with public-blockchain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) were thought to be untraceable. With developments in blockchain analysis, it became clear that transactions can actually be traced back to the senders, posing a great threat to users' privacy.  To solve this issue, BEAM came up with innovative ways of increasing the anonymity of transactions, address balances and user identities. Beam runs on the Mimblewimble protocol and was launched in March 2018. Who Are the Founders of BEAM?  Some of the leading team members of Beam include Alexander Zaidelson, Alex Romanov and Amir Aaronson. Alexander Zaidelson is the project’s CEO.

Alex Romanov, the CTO, has worked with large teams on several complex projects.  Besides working on Beam, Amir Aaronson, the COO, has co-founded several technological companies. What Makes Beam Unique?  Beam allows financial counterparties to make safe, stable and reliable transactions. This helps eliminate the problem of user data mismanagement, keeping the system cleaner and more secure. Beam’s blockchain was built on the C++ programming language from scratch.  User addresses are kept confidential at all times and are never disclosed to any third parties. Users have total access and control over their privacy, deciding who can access their information and what they are allowed to see.  Beam supports custom transactions of different types, such as  escrow , atomic swaps and time-locked ones. How Many Beam (BEAM) Coins Are There in Circulation?
